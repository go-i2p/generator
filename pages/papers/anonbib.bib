  title={Deciding Your Own Anonymity: User-Oriented Node Selection in I2P},
  year={2018},
  month={November},
  volume={6},
  number={},
  pages={71350--71359},
  abstract={With the development of Internet applications, anonymous communication technology plays a very significant role in protecting personal privacy. As one of the most popular anonymous communication systems, I2P provides strong anonymity through its encryption and communication schemes. However, I2P does not consider the users' preferences, which is difficult to meet the individual demands of specific users and then allows them to decide their anonymity. Thus, this paper proposes two novel user-oriented node selection algorithms that can effectively enhance the anonymity or reduce the communication delay over the I2P network. In order to choose proper nodes, we also investigate key factors to evaluate the nodes. Then, the basic node selection algorithm (BNSA) is proposed to group routing nodes and provide high-performance node candidates. Based on BNSA, the geographic-diversity-oriented node selection algorithm (GDNSA) and the communication-delay-oriented node selection algorithm (CDNSA) are proposed. These can improve the anonymity or communication performance of the I2P network. The GDNSA increases the attack difficulty by establishing tunnels that span multiple regions. In the meantime, the CDNSA reduces the communication delay of the tunnel by selecting the next hop node with the lowest communication delay. Finally, the mathematical analysis and experimental results show that the GDNSA has good resistance to collusion attacks, and the CDNSA reduces the communication delay in spite of weakening a little anonymity},

  abstract={Tor and i2p networks are two of the most popular darknets. Both darknets have become an area of illegal activities highlighting the necessity to study and analyze them to identify and report illegal content to Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). This paper analyzes the connections between the Tor network and the i2p network. We created the first dataset that combines information from Tor and i2p networks. The dataset contains more than 49k darknet services. The process of building and analyzing the dataset shows that it is not possible to explore one of the networks without considering the other. Both networks work as an ecosystem and there are clear paths between them. Using graph analysis, we also identified the most relevant domains, the prominent types of services in each network, and their relations. Findings are relevant to LEAs and researchers aiming to crawl and investigate i2p and Tor networks.},

I2P uses a variation of Onion routing, thus assuring the unlinkability between a user and its file-sharing application. In this paper, we take the first step towards the linkability of users and applications in the I2P network. We conduct a group-based characterisation, where we determine to what extent a group of users is responsible for the overall I2P's file-sharing activity. We used Pearson's coefficient to correlate users from two cities and the most used anonymous file-sharing application. We determine that two cities explain more than a third of all file-sharing activity within the I2P network.}},

    abstract = {{Anonymous communication has gained more and more interest from Internet users as privacy and anonymity problems have emerged. Dedicated anonymous networks such as Freenet and I2P allow anonymous file-sharing among users. However, one major problem with anonymous file-sharing networks is that the available content is highly reduced, mostly with outdated files, and non-anonymous networks, such as the BitTorrent network, are still the major source of content: we show that in a 30-days period, 21648 new torrents were introduced in the BitTorrent community, whilst only 236 were introduced in the anonymous I2P network, for four different categories of content. Therefore, how can a user of these anonymous networks access this varied and non-anonymous content without compromising its anonymity? In this paper, we improve content availability in an anonymous environment by proposing the first internetwork model allowing anonymous users to access and share content in large public communities while remaining anonymous. We show that our approach can efficiently interconnect I2P users and public BitTorrent swarms without affecting their anonymity nor their performance. Our model is fully implemented and freely usable.}},

    abstract = {{Anonymous communications have been gaining more and more interest from Internet users as privacy and anonymity problems have emerged. Among anonymous enabled services, anonymous file-sharing is one of the most active one and is increasingly growing. Large scale monitoring on these systems allows us to grasp how they behave, which type of data is shared among users, the overall behaviour in the system. But does large scale monitoring jeopardize the system anonymity? In this work we present the first large scale monitoring architecture and experiments on the I2P network, a low-latency message-oriented anonymous network. We characterize the file-sharing environment within I2P, and evaluate if this monitoring affects the anonymity provided by the network. We show that most activities within the network are file-sharing oriented, along with anonymous web-hosting. We assess the wide geographical location of nodes and network popularity. We also demonstrate that group-based profiling is feasible on this particular network.}},

  abstract={{Today, to be monitored while surfing the web seems to be a natural act and thus tools and applications to achieve online anonymity are more important than ever. The usability of such a tool plays not only a prominent role for each single user; in the area of anonymization networks it usually holds that the protection for every single user is higher, the more users participate. Hence, usability is of great importance, since bad usability decreases the number of potential users. In this paper we examine the usability of four software implementations for anonymous communication techniques especially with regards to the installation procedure. The usability is evaluated with the help of cognitive walk-throughs. We also inspect the quality of service of these implementations by means of a performance test.}},

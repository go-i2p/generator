<h2>I2P Router Help</h2>
<h3 id="systems"><span class="permalink"><a href="#systems">
{% trans %}What systems will I2P run on?{% endtrans %}</a> </span></h3>
<p>{% trans java='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)',
android=get_url('downloads_list')+"#android" -%}

I2P is written in the <a href="{{ java }}">Java programming language</a>. 
It has been tested on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and OSX. 
An <a href="{{ android }}">Android port</a> is also available.{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}In terms of memory usage, I2P is configured to use 128 MB of RAM by default. 
This is sufficient for browsing and IRC usage. However, other activities may require greater memory allocation. 
For example, if one wishes to run a high-bandwidth router, participate in I2P torrents or serve high-traffic hidden services, 
a higher amount of memory is required.{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans rpi='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi' -%}
In terms of CPU usage, I2P has been tested to run on modest systems such as the <a href="{{ rpi }}">Raspberry Pi</a> range of single-board computers.
As I2P makes heavy use of cryptographic techniques, a stronger CPU will be better suited to handle the workload generated by I2P as well as tasks 
related to the rest of the system (i.e. Operating System, GUI, Other processes e.g. Web Browsing).{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans chart='https://trac.i2p2.de/wiki/java' -%}A comparison of some of the available Java Runtime Environments (JRE) is available here: 
<a href="{{ chart }}">{{ chart }}</a>.

Using Sun/Oracle Java or OpenJDK is recommended.

<h3 id="java"><span class="permalink"><a href="#java">
{% trans %}Is installing Java required to use I2P?{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans alt=site_url('about/alternative-clients') -%}
While the main I2P client implementation requires Java, there are several
<a href="{{ alt }}">alternative clients</a> which don't require Java.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h3 id="I2P Site"><span class="permalink"><a href="#I2P Site">
{% trans %}What is an "I2P Site?"{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans browsers=site_url('about/browser-config') -%}
Formerly called an eepSite, an I2P Site is a website that is hosted anonymously, a hidden service which is accessible through your web browser. 
It can be accessed by setting your web browser's HTTP proxy to use the I2P web proxy (typically it listens on localhost port 4444), and browsing to the site. Detailed instructions for configuring your browse can be found on the <a href="{{ browsers }}">browser configuration page</a>.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h3 id="active"><span class="permalink"><a href="#active">
{% trans %}What do the Active x/y numbers mean in the router console?{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
x is the number of peers you've sent or received a message from successfully in the last minute, y is the number of peers seen in the last hour or so. 
Try hovering your cursor over the other lines of information for a brief description.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h3 id="badcontent"><span class="permalink"><a href="#badcontent">
{% trans %}I am opposed to certain types of content. How do I keep from distributing, storing, or accessing them?{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans -%} 
I2P traffic that transits through your router is encrypted with several layers of encryption. 
Except in the case of a serious security vulnerability (of which none are currently known), 
it is not possible to know the content, origin or destination of routed traffic.  
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<ul>
<li>
{% trans -%}
<b>Distribution</b><br> 
All traffic on the I2P network is encrypted in multiple layers. You don't know a message's contents, source, or destination.
Traffic is internal to the I2P network, you are not an <a href="#exit">exit node</a> (referred to as an outproxy in our documentation).
{%- endtrans %}
</li>
<li>
{% trans -%}
<b>Storage</b><br> 
The I2P network does not do distributed storage of content, this has to be specifically installed and configured by the user (with Tahoe-LAFS, for example). 
That is a feature of a different anonymous network, <a href="http://freenetproject.org/">Freenet</a>.
By running an I2P router, you are not storing content for anyone.
{%- endtrans %}
</li>
<li>
{% trans -%}
<b>Access</b><br>
Your router will not request any content without your specific instruction to do so.{%- endtrans %}
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="blocking"><span class="permalink"><a href="#blocking">Is it possible to block I2P?</a></span></h3>
<p>{% trans %}Yes, by far the easiest and most common way is by blocking bootstrap, or "Reseed" servers. Completely blocking all obfuscated traffic
would work as well (although it would break many, many other things that are not I2P and most are not willing to go this far).
In the case of reseed blocking, there is a reseed bundle on Github, blocking it will also block Github.
You can reseed over a proxy (many can be found on Internet if you do not want to use Tor) or share reseed bundles on a friend-to-friend basis offline.{% endtrans %}</p>

<h3 id="protocolfamily"><span class="permalink"><a href="#protocolfamily">
{% trans %}In <code>wrapper.log</code> I see an error that states "<code>Protocol family unavailable</code>" when loading the Router Console{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
Often this error will occur with any network enabled java software on some systems that are configured to use IPv6 by default. There are a few ways to solve this:
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<ul>
  <li>
{% trans %}On Linux based systems, you can <code>echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/bindv6only</code>{% endtrans %}
</li>
  <li>{% trans %}Look for the following lines in <code>wrapper.config</code>.{% endtrans %}<br />
<code>#wrapper.java.additional.5=-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true<br />
      #wrapper.java.additional.6=-Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=false<br />
</code><br />
  {% trans %}If the lines are there, uncomment them by removing the "#"s. If the lines are not there, add them without the "#"s.{% endtrans %}
  </li>
</ul>
{% trans -%}
Another option would be to remove the <strong>::1</strong> from <code>~/.i2p/clients.config</code>
{%- endtrans %}

<p>{% trans -%}
<strong>WARNING</strong>: For any changes to <code>wrapper.config</code> to take effect, you must completely
stop the router and the wrapper. Clicking <em>Restart</em> on your
router console will NOT reread this file! You must
click <em>Shutdown</em>, wait 11 minutes, then start I2P.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h3 id="down"><span class="permalink"><a href="#down">
{% trans %}Most of the I2P Sites within I2P are down?{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans eepstatus='http://'+i2pconv('identiguy.i2p') -%}
If you consider every I2P Site that has ever been created, yes, most of them are down.
People and I2P Sites come and go.
A good way to get started in I2P is check out a list of I2P Sites that are currently up.
<a href="{{ eepstatus }}">{{ eepstatus }}</a> tracks active I2P Sites.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h3 id="port32000"><span class="permalink"><a href="#port32000">
{% trans %}Why is I2P listening on port 32000?{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
The Tanuki java service wrapper that we use opens this port &mdash;bound to localhost&mdash; in order to communicate with software running inside the JVM. 
When the JVM is launched it is given a key so it can connect to the wrapper. 
After the JVM establishes its connection to the wrapper, the wrapper refuses any additional connections.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<p>{% trans -%}
More information can be found in the <a href="http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.com/doc/english/prop-port.html">wrapper documentation</a>.

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<h3 id="browserproxy"><span class="permalink"><a href="#browserproxy">
{% trans %}How do I configure my browser?{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans browserconfig=site_url('about/browser-config') -%}
The proxy config for different browsers is on a <a href="{{ browserconfig }}"> separate page</a> with screenshots. 
More advanced configs with external tools, such as the browser plug-in FoxyProxy or the proxy server Privoxy, are possible but could introduce leaks in your setup.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h3 id="irc"><span class="permalink"><a href="#irc">
{% trans %}How do I connect to IRC within I2P?{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans %}
A tunnel to the main IRC server within I2P, Irc2P, is created when I2P is installed (see the <a href="http://localhost:7657/i2ptunnel/index.jsp">I2PTunnel configuration page</a>), and is automatically started when the I2P router starts. 
To connect to it, tell your IRC client to connect to <code>localhost 6668</code>. 
HexChat-like client users can create a new network with the server <code>localhost/6668</code> (remember to tick "Bypass proxy server" if you have a proxy server configured).
Weechat users can use the following command to add a new network:
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<code>
  <pre>
    /server add irc2p localhost/6668
  </pre>
</code>

<h3 id="myI2P Site"><span class="permalink"><a href="#myI2P Site">
{% trans %}How do I set up my own I2P Site?{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
Click on the <a href="http://localhost:7658/">Website</a> link at the top of your router console for instructions.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h3 id="hosting">{% trans %}If I host a website at I2P at home, containing only HTML and CSS, is it dangerous?{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>{% trans %}If you're hosting a personal blog or doing something otherwise non-sensitive, then you are obviously in little danger.
If you have privacy needs that are basically non-specific, you are in little danger. If you are hosting something sensitive, then
your services will go down at the same time that your router goes down. Someone who observes your downtime and correlates it to
real-world events could probably de-anonymize you with enough effort. I2P has defenses available against this like multihoming or
Tahoe-LAFS, but they require additional set up and are only appropriate for some threat models. There is no magic solution, protecting
yourself from a real threat will take real consideration in any case.{% endtrans %}</p>

<h3 id="addresses">{% trans %}How Does I2P find ".i2p" websites? {% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>The I2P Address Book application maps human-readable names to long-term destinations, associated with services, making it more like a hosts file or a contact list than a network database or a DNS service. It's also local-first there is no recognized global namespace, you decide what any given .i2p domain maps to in the end. The middle-ground is something called a "Jump Service" which provides a human-readable name by redirecting you to a page where you will be asked "Do you give the I2P router permission to call $SITE_CRYPTO_KEY the name $SITE_NAME.i2p" or something to that effect. Once it's in your address book, you can generate your own jump URL's to help share the site with others. </p>

<h3 id="addressbook">{% trans %}How do I add addresses to the Address Book? {% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>{% trans %}You cannot add an address without knowing at least the base32 or base64 of the site you want to visit. The "hostname" which is human-readable is only an alias for the cryptographic address, which corresponds to the base32 or base64. Without the cryptographic address, there is no way to access an I2P Site, this is by design. Distributing the address to people who do not know it yet is usually the responsibility of the Jump service provider. Visiting an I2P Site which is unknown will trigger the use of a Jump service. stats.i2p is the most reliable Jump service.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}If you're hosting a site via i2ptunnel, then it won't have a registration with a jump service yet. To give it a URL locally, then visit the configuration page and click the button that says "Add to Local Address Book." Then go to http://127.0.0.1:7657/dns to look up the addresshelper URL and share it.{% endtrans %}</p>

<h3 id="ports"><span class="permalink"><a href="#ports">
{% trans %}What ports does I2P use?{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
The ports that are used by I2P can be divided into 2 sections: 
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<ol>
  <li>{% trans %}Internet-facing ports, which are used for communication with other I2P routers{% endtrans %}</li>
  <li>{% trans %}Local ports, for local connections{% endtrans %}</li>

{%- endtrans %}</p>

<ol>
  <li>{% trans -%}Internet-facing ports<br> Note: Since release 0.7.8, new installs do not use port 8887;

The local I2P ports and the I2PTunnel ports do not need to be reachable from 
remote machines, but *should* be reachable locally.  You can also create 
additional ports for I2PTunnel instances via http://localhost:7657/i2ptunnel/

So, to summarize, nothing needs to be reachable by unsolicited remote peers, but

      Your remote I2P console will now be available on your local system as 'http://localhost:7657' and will be available for as long as your SSH session is active. 
      If you would like to start an SSH session without initiating a shell on the remote system, you can add the '-N' flag:

Many applications leak sensitive information that could identify you on the Internet and this is a risk that one should be aware of when using the I2P SOCKS proxy. 
I2P only filters connection data, but if the program you intend to run sends this information as content, I2P has no way to protect your anonymity. 
For example, some mail applications will send the IP address of the machine they are running on to a mail server. 
There is no way for I2P to filter this, thus using I2P to 'socksify' existing applications is possible, but extremely dangerous.

Unless an outproxy has been specifically set up for the service you want to connect to, this cannot be done. 
There are only three types of outproxies running right now: HTTP, HTTPS, and email. Note that there is no SOCKS outproxy. 
If this type of service is required, we recommend that you use Tor.

The most reliable way to know for sure would be to have a computer with a fairly stable IP address that you suspect is an I2P user, and a

to see their I2P router in the netDB. This might take time, and it might never happen. You could also try blocking all obfuscated traffic
on a particular network until you're sure every I2P router on that network has lost all of it's peers. At that point, they'll reach out

I2P does not encrypt the Internet, neither does Tor - for example, through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</a>. 
I2P and Tor both aim to transport your traffic as-is securely and anonymously over the corresponding network, to its destination. 
Any unencrypted traffic generated at your system will arrive at the outproxy (on I2P) or the exit node (on Tor) as unencrypted traffic. 
This means that you are vulnerable to snooping by the outproxy operators. 
One way to protect your outproxy traffic against this is to ensure that any traffic that will be handled by the outproxy is encrypted with TLS.

A typical symptom of a failed reseed is the "Known" indicator (on the left

firewall limits outbound traffic or if the reseed request is blocked entirely.

    FTP is not supported for technical reasons.

    There are no FTP "outproxies" to the Internet—it may not even be possible to set up one. 
    Any other kind of outproxy may work if it's set up with a standard tunnel. 
    If you would like to set up some type of outproxy, carefully research the potential risks. 
    The I2P community may or may not be able to help with the technical aspects, feel free to ask.

    As explained several times above, any existing outproxy isn't a core part of the network. 
    They are services run by individuals and they may or may not be operational at any given time.

<p>{% trans -%}
There are many possible causes of high CPU usage. Here is a checklist:
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<ul>
<li>
  <b>{% trans -%}Java Runtime Environment{%- endtrans %}</b><br>
{% trans -%}Try to use either OpenJDK or Sun/Oracle Java if it's available for your system. 
You can check which version of java you have installed by typing <code>java -version</code> at a command/shell prompt. 
Performance tends to suffer with other implementations of java.{%- endtrans %}
</li>
<li>
  <b>{% trans -%}File sharing applications, e.g. BitTorrent{%- endtrans %}</b><br>
{% trans -%}
Are you running a BitTorrent client over I2P? Try reducing the number of torrents, the bandwidth limits,
or try turning it off completely to see if that helps.
{%- endtrans %}
</li>
<li>
  <b>{% trans -%}High bandwidth settings{%- endtrans %}</b><br>
{% trans -%}
Are your bandwidth limits set too high? It is possible that too much traffic is going through your I2P router and it is overloaded. 
Try reducing the setting for <em>share bandwidth percentage</em> on the <a href="http://localhost:7657/config">configuration</a> page.
{%- endtrans %}</li>
<li>
  <b>{% trans -%}I2P Version{%- endtrans %}</b><br>
{% trans -%}
Make sure that you're running the latest version of I2P to get the benefits of increased performance and bug fixes.
{%- endtrans %}
</li>
<li>
  <b>{% trans -%}Memory allocation{%- endtrans %}</b><br>
{% trans -%}
Has enough memory been set aside for use by I2P? Look at the memory graph on <a href="http://localhost:7657/graphs">the graphs page</a> 
to see if the memory usage is "pegged"&mdash;the JVM is spending most of its time in garbage collection. 
Increase the setting <code>wrapper.java.maxmemory</code> in the file <code>wrapper.config</code>.
{%- endtrans %}
</li>
<li>
  <b>{% trans -%}Bursts of high-usage vs. constant 100% usage{%- endtrans %}</b><br>
{% trans -%}
Is the CPU usage simply higher than you would like, or is it pegged at 100&#37; for a long time?
If it is pegged, this could be a bug. Look in the logs for clues.
{%- endtrans %}
</li>
<li>
  <b>{% trans -%}Java-related{%- endtrans %}</b><br>
{% trans jbigi=site_url('misc/jbigi') -%}
You may be using the Java-based BigInteger library instead of the native version, especially if you are running on a new or unusual OS or hardware (OpenSolaris, mipsel, etc.).
See the <a href="{{ jbigi }}">jbigi page</a> for instructions on diagnosing, building, and testing methods.
{%- endtrans %}
</li>
<li>
  <b>{% trans -%}Participating tunnels{%- endtrans %}</b><br>
{% trans -%}
If your native jbigi library is working fine, the biggest user of CPU may be routing traffic for participating tunnels. 
This uses CPU because at each hop a layer of encryption must be decoded. You can limit participating traffic in two ways -
by reducing the share bandwidth on the <a href="http://localhost:7657/confignet.jsp">confignet</a> page,
or by setting <tt>router.maxParticipatingTunnels=nnn</tt> on the <a href="http://localhost:7657/configadvanced.jsp">configadvanced</a> page.
{%- endtrans %}
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="peers"><span class="permalink"><a href="#peers">
{% trans %}My router has very few active peers, is this OK?{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
If your router has 10 or more active peers, everything is fine. 
The router should maintain connections to a few peers at all times. 
The best way to stay "better-connected" to the network is to share more bandwidth. 
The amount of bandwidth that is shared by the router can be changed on the configuration page: 
  <a href="http://localhost:7657/config">http://localhost:7657/config</a>
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h3 id="vary"><span class="permalink"><a href="#vary">
{% trans %}My active peers / known peers / participating tunnels / connections / bandwidth vary dramatically over time! Is anything wrong?{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
No, there isn't anything wrong. 
This is normal behavior. 
All routers adjust dynamically to changing network conditions and demands. 
Routers come online and go offline depending on whether the system it is installed on is operational or not, as well as whether there is an available network connection. 
Your router is constantly updating its local Network Database. 
Tunnels which your router is participating in expire every 10 minutes and may or may not be rebuilt through your router.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h3 id="slow"><span class="permalink"><a href="#slow">
{% trans %}What makes downloads, torrents, web browsing, and everything else slower on I2P as compared to the regular internet?{% endtrans %}</a></span>
</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
The encryption and routing within the I2P network adds a substantial amount of overhead and limits bandwidth. 

We can try to clarify this with the aid of a diagram:
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<img src="/_static/images/i2p_traffic_path.jpg">

<p>{% trans -%}
In this diagram, the path that some I2P traffic takes as it travels through the network is traced. 
A user's I2P router is denoted by the box labeled 'A' and an I2P Hidden Service (for example, the http://stats.i2p website) is labelled as 'B'. 
Both the client and the server are using 3-hop tunnels, these hops are represented by the boxes labelled 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', 'P_1', 'Q_1', 'R'_1, 'X_1', 'Y_1' and 'Z_1'.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
The boxes labelled 'P', 'Q' and 'R' represent an outbound tunnel for A while the boxes labelled 'X_1', 'Y_1', 'Z_1' represent an outbound tunnel for 'B'. 
Similarly, the boxes labelled 'X', 'Y' and 'Z' represent and inbound tunnel for 'B' while the boxes labelled 'P_1', 'Q_1' and 'R_1' represent an inbound tunnel for 'A'. 
The arrows in between the boxes show the direction of traffic. 
The text above and below the arrows detail some example bandwidth between a pair of hops as well as example latencies.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
When both client and server are using 3-hop tunnels throughout, a total of 12 other I2P routers are involved in relaying traffic. 
6 peers relay traffic from the client to the server which is split into a 3-hop outbound tunnel from 'A' ('P', 'Q', 'R') and a 3-hop inbound tunnel to 'B' ('X', 'Y', 'Z').  
Similarly, 6 peers relay traffic from the server to back to the client.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
First, we can consider latency - the time that it takes for a request from a client to traverse the I2P network, reach the the server and traverse back to the client. 
Adding up all latencies we see that:
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<code>
<pre>
      40 + 100 + 20 + 60 + 80 + 10 + 30 ms        (client to server)
    + 60 + 40 + 80 + 60 + 100 + 20 + 40 ms        (server to client) 
    -----------------------------------
    TOTAL:                          740 ms
</pre>
</code>

<p>{% trans -%}
The total round-trip time in our example adds up to 740 ms - certainly much higher than what one would normally see while browsing regular internet websites.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
Second, we can consider available bandwidth. 
This is determined through the slowest link between hops from the client and server as well as when traffic is being transmitted by the server to the client. 
For traffic going from the client to the server, we see that the available bandwidth in our example between hops 'R' &amp; 'X' as well as hops 'X' &amp; 'Y' is 32 KB/s. 
Despite higher available bandwidth between the other hops, these hops will act as a bottleneck and will limit the maximum available bandwidth for traffic from 'A' to 'B' at 32 KB/s. 
Similarly, tracing the path from server to client shows that there is maximum bandwidth of 64 KB/s - between hops 'Z_1' &amp; 'Y_1, 'Y_1' &amp; 'X_1' and 'Q_1' &amp; 'P_1'.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
We recommend increasing your bandwidth limits. 
This helps the network by increasing the amount of available bandwidth which will in turn improve your I2P experience. 
Bandwidth settings are located on the <a href="http://localhost:7657/config">http://localhost:7657/config</a> page. 
Please be aware of your internet connection's limits as determined by your ISP, and adjust your settings accordingly. 
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
We also recommend setting a sufficient amount of shared bandwidth - this allows for participating tunnels to be routed through your I2P router. 
Allowing participating traffic keeps your router well-integrated in the network and improves your transfer speeds.

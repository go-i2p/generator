<h2>{% trans %}Overview{% endtrans %}</h2>

<p>{% trans -%}
Thank you for volunteering to run an I2P reseed server.
"Reseeding" is our term for bootstrapping new routers into the network.
New routers fetch a bundle of peer references, or "router infos", from one or more of a hardcoded list of HTTPS URLs.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h2>{% trans %}Requirements{% endtrans %}</h2>

<p>{% trans -%}
At its simplest, a reseed server consists of a Java I2P router, an HTTPS web server,
and some scripts that periodically gather router infos from the router,
bundle and sign them into a custom file format, and deliver these files over HTTPS.
In practice, it's a bit more complex, and a reseed operator must be fairly competent and attentive.
A reseed server is not appropriate for a residential internet connection. The complexities include:
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<ul>
<li>{% trans -%}
You must have a secure SSL setup with either a self-signed certificate or a cert that chains up to a standard CA
{%- endtrans %}</li>
<li>{% trans -%}
The SSL configuration must conform to current best practices on allowed ciphers and protocols, and the CN/SAN host name must match the URL
{%- endtrans %}</li>
<li>{% trans -%}
The scripts are designed to deliver different router info bundles to different requestors for network diversity
{%- endtrans %}</li>
<li>{% trans -%}
The scripts are designed to deliver the same bundle to the same repeated requestor to prevent scraping
{%- endtrans %}</li>
<li>{% trans -%}
The reseed servers are under periodic attacks and DDoS attempts, and from other buggy I2P implementations and botnets.
This necessitates that you run fail2ban or an equivalent solution.
{%- endtrans %}</li>
</ul>

<h2>{% trans %}Information Required{% endtrans %}</h2>

<p>{% trans -%}
When your setup is complete and ready for testing, we will need the HTTPS URL,
the SSL public key certificate (only if selfsigned), and the su3 public key certificate.
After testing is complete, these will be added to the hardcoded entries in the Java and C++ routers in the next release,
and you will start seeing traffic.
We also will need your email address so we may continue to contact you about reseed administration issues.
The email will not be made public but will be known to the other reseed operators.
You should expect that your nick or name and its association with that URL or IP will become public.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h2>{% trans %}Privacy Policy{% endtrans %}</h2>

<p>{% trans -%}
A reseed operator is a trusted role in the network.
While we do not yet have a formal privacy policy, you must ensure the privacy of our users
by not publicizing logs or IPs found in those logs, except as necessary to discuss administration issues with the I2P reseed team.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h2>{% trans %}Financial Support{% endtrans %}</h2>

<p>{% trans -%}
Modest financial support may be available to those running reseed servers.
This support would be in partial reimbursement for your server costs.
Support will not be paid in advance and will probably not cover all your expenses.
Support is only available to those who have been running reseed servers in good standing for several months, and is based on actual need.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
If you would like to discuss support, please contact echelon and CC: zzz
{%- endtrans %}</p>


<h2>{% trans %}Getting Started{% endtrans %}</h2>

<p>{% trans -%}
Our reseed coordinator is "zzz" and he may be contacted at zzz at mail.i2p or zzz at i2pmail.org.
Unfortunately, he is not generally on IRC. The reseed setup is somewhat specialized, and you should direct most questions to him.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
For actual implementation, details below. We have one recommended reseed solution:
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<ul>
<li>{% trans -%}
A Go implementation that includes the web server and all the scripts. This is the recommended solution.
{%- endtrans %}</li>

</ul>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
Public reseed servers are necessary to bootstrap into the I2P net.
New installed I2P routers needs one-time about one hundred RouterInfo's (RI) as jump start.
</p>
<p>
RI contains IP and Port from other I2P routers and are stored in dat-files in the netDB folder.
</p>
<p>
A random bunch of dat-files from the netDB are zipped, then signed to a su3-file
and finally offered to I2P routers seeking reseed service.
</p>
<p>
To secure bootstrap and enable a trusted start, HTTPS/TLS and signed su3-files are mandatory.
</p>
<p>
It is essential not to publish all RI from netDB, or all RI to one client.
</p>


<h2>2. Requirements</h2>

<p>
Requirements for running a public reseed server:
<ul>
<li>Well integrated running I2P router @ 24/7
<li>Server with static IPv4 (2 cpu/ 2GB ram is fine)
<li>Unix to run the golang solution
<li>Own domain, sub-domain or an anonymous third-level domain
<li>A self-signed SSL certificate, or an SSL certificate from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org" target="_blank">Let's Encrypt</a>
<li>Enough bandwidth and traffic volume - Around 15 GB/month as of December 2016
<li>Up-to-date web server (Apache/nginx), HTTPS ONLY with TLS 1.2 and good ciphers
</ul>
Optional:
<ul>
<li>fail2ban to protect you from botnets
<li>GnuPG/PGP for signed/encrypted emails
<li>IPv6
</ul>

<p>
This How-to is tested with Ubuntu/Debian as well as FreeBSD.
The web server has to be public reachable from all over the world, an I2P Site inside I2P can be setup in addition.
Also frequent or infrequent attempts to scrape all your reseed files, and of course attacks on your server.
The web server doesn't need to listen at default SSL/TLS port 443 - any other port can be used for obfuscation.
</p>


<h2>3. Go Solution - Quick Guide</h2>

<h3>1. Fire Up Your Favorite Webserver</h3>
<ol><li>
	Connect a domain, sub-domain or (anonymous) third-level-domain
</li><li>
	Setup a state-of-the-art TLS(SSL) certificate
</li><li>
	Allow access only via HTTPS/TLS, no unencrypted HTTP
</li><li>
  Allow only very good ciphers, compatible to Java 7/8/9. See <a href="https://cipherli.st/" target="_blank">Cipherli.st</a>
</li></ol>
<p>
Note: A non default port other than 443 can be used; TLS certificate can be self signed; configure fail2ban as bot-net protection
</p>


<h3>2. Install git and golang-go (1.4.2 or higher)</h3>
<pre>
	Debian/Ubuntu:    sudo apt install git golang-go
        Arch:             sudo pacman -s git go
</pre>


<h3>3. Switch To User Running I2P, Fetch the i2p-tool Source Code, Build and Test it</h3>
<p>
Note: Visit http://reseed.i2p and download a pre-build x86_64 binary, so you can skip step 2+3.
</p>
<pre>
	export GOPATH=$HOME/go; mkdir $GOPATH; cd $GOPATH
	go get github.com/martin61/i2p-tools
	bin/i2p-tools -h
</pre>


<h3>4. Run i2p-tools locally, </h3>
<p>
Replace 'yourname@mail.i2p' with your email address
Replace '/home/i/.i2p/netDb' with the path to the I2P 'netDb' in the home folder of the user running I2P
</p>
<pre>
	GOPATH=$HOME/go;
        cd $GOPATH;
        bin/i2p-tools reseed --signer=yourname@mail.i2p \
                             --netdb=/home/i/.i2p/netDb \
                             --port=8443 \
                             --ip=127.0.0.1 \
                             --trustProxy
</pre>


<h3>5. Back Up New Certificates</h3>
<p>
Make a backup from the newly created su3-signing key and certificate found in $GOPATH (.crt/.pem/.crl) and keep it in a safe, password protected location
</p>


<h3>6. Enable Autostart (+restart) for i2p-tools in Your crontab</h3>
<p>
Replace '...' with the appropriate command-line arguments as in step 4
</p>
<pre>
	@reboot   GOPATH=$HOME/go; cd $GOPATH; bin/i2p-tools reseed ... &gt;/dev/null 2>&amp;1
	9 * * * * GOPATH=$HOME/go; cd $GOPATH; bin/i2p-tools reseed ... &gt;/dev/null 2>&amp;1
</pre>

<h3>7. Connect Your Webserver via Reverse-Proxy setup to the i2p-tool, Examples</h3>
<p>
<b>lighttpd is no longer supported due to a limitation with the 'X-Forwarded-For' HTTP Header. Please use Apache or nginx.</b>
</p>
<p>
	nginx configuration example:
</p>
<pre>
		location / {
			proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8443;
                        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP  $remote_addr;
                        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
		}
</pre>
<p>
	Apache (untested - feedback would be appreciated)
</p>
<pre>
		ProxyRequests Off
		&lt;Proxy *&gt;
			Order deny,allow
			Allow from all
		&lt;/Proxy&gt;
		ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8443/
		ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8443/
</pre>
<p>
Additionally, ensure that your webserver uses these suggested settings for Strong SSL Security (visit <a href="https://cipherli.st/" target="_blank">CipherLi.st</a> for the latest settings). Sample SSL settings are provided in section <b>4.5 Reverse-Proxy Setup</b>.
</p>

<p>
Note: i2p-tool has also an build-in standalone webserver with TLS support which can be used without a webserver. Please contact (zzz at mail.i2p.de) if you need help, or stop by #i2p-dev on IRC2P and talk to other reseed operators.
</p>


<h3>8. Final Test From Another Computer With I2P Running</h3>
<ol><li>
	Place your su3-certificate (*.crt) in i2p/certificates/reseed/
</li><li>
	Place your TLS-certificate (*.crt) in i2p/certificates/ssl/
</li><li>
	Visit with your web browser http://localhost:7657/configreseed
</li><li>
	Enter your new reseed-url and delete all others, hit "Save changes and reseed now"
</li><li>
	Check the I2P logs for "Reseed got 77 router infos from ... with 0 errors, Reseed complete, 77 received"
</li></ol>


<h3>9. Send Us Your Information</h3>
<ol><li>
	Domain/URL/Port
</li><li>
	su3-signing certificate
</li><li>
	TLS certificate (if self signed)
</li></ol>
<p>
Send an email: zzz at mail.i2p, PGP signed welcome :-)


<h2>4. Go Solution - Detailed Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Overview</h3>

<p>
The previous steps for reseeding involves many steps, scripts and programs.
Most of them are easy and plain straight forward, but overall you can call it a little confusing.

<p>
Here comes now an all-in-one solution from matt (Big Thanks!) for providing
a reseed server which merges the following functions into one binary:

<ul>
<li>Create su3-files
<li>Create su3 signer certificate+key
<li>Create SSL-certificate+key
<li>Replaces the http-server and the PHP code (or run next to them in parallel)
</ul>

<p>
Almost all previous used scripts and described steps are not needed with this solution,
but to understand the overall reseed process it is recommended to read them too :-)

<ul>
<li>If you already have an SSL-certificate and su3-signer-key you can reuse them, see one of the following chapter.
<li>For testing and new reseeders the required certs and keys are created automatically at first start.
<li>Also take a look at the content and the naming scheme of these pem and crt files.
</ul>

<p>
Of course you need an up-to-date netDB folder with routerinfos from a running I2P router.
I2P does not have to be running on the same machine as this reseed binary.
In this case you can setup a cronjob to transfer the netDB from the I2P machine to the reseed machine.

<p>
Matt's go solution can be used in parallel next to an already running http-server.
For this leave the http-server running at normal port 80 and 443,
and configure Go solution too use another port, e.g. port 8443.

<p>

<h3>2. Building From Source</h3>

<p>
Requirements:
<ul>
<li>go1.4.2 (older versions may not work)
</ul>

<p>
Install go from https://golang.org/doc/install, example for 64 bit Ubuntu/Debian:
<ul>
<li>wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.4.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
<li>sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.4.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
<li>mkdir $HOME/go
<li>edit /etc/profile and add:
<pre>
	export GOPATH=$HOME/go
	export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$GOPATH/bin
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
Verify go:
<pre>
$ go version
</pre>
which should state something like: "go version go1.4.2"

<p>
Install Go solution from https://github.com/martin61/i2p-tools into $HOME/go:
<pre>
$ go get github.com/martin61/i2p-tools
</pre>

<p>
This will install a binary to $GOPATH/bin/i2p-tools

<p>
Run the go solution, the usage/help should be displayed, nothing more:
<pre>
$ i2p-tools
</pre>

<h3>3. Run the Reseed Server</h3>

<pre>
$ i2p-tools reseed --tlsHost=myserver.com --signer=myemail@mail.i2p --netdb=$HOME/.i2p/netDb
</pre>

<ul>
<li>Replace myserver.com with your real domain
<li>Replace myemail@mail.i2p with a valid existing email, which you want to use for reseeding purpose
<li>New TLS certificate+key will be created (if they do not exist)
<li>New signing certificate+key will be created (if they do not exist)
<li>netdb=... should point to the netdb folder of your running I2P with the routerinfos
<li>To use another port append "--port=443" to the command, default is port 8443
</ul>

<p>
Output:
<pre>
2015/03/15 12:28:25 Rebuilding su3 cache...
2015/03/15 12:28:25 Building 200 su3 files each containing 75 out of 3180 routerInfos.
2015/03/15 12:28:35 Done rebuilding.
2015/03/15 12:28:35 HTTPS server started on 0.0.0.0:8443
</pre>

<p>
So you can now test to reach the server at port 8443, see a previous chapter about proper testing.

<p>
Some remarks:
<ul>
<li>Don't run the server daemon as root
<li>Every port between 1024 and 49151 is fine for I2P.
<li>If you want to use the privileged (https-default) port 443, create a port redirect, e.g.
    <pre>'iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8443'</pre>
<li>Redirect the output from the go solution to a logfile, format is default apache-style combined logs
<li>Add a logrotate for the logfiles, since they grow big :-(
<li>Logfiles can be used by fail2ban
<li>Both of the certificates (*.crt) will need to be sent to the reseed maintainer
in order for your reseed server to be included in the standard I2P package.
<li>Add a proper startup script, to run the reseed server, see next chapter
</ul>


<h3>4. Draft for Startup Script "seedserver"</h3>

<p>
The reseed server should be started automatically, so you need a init.d or some sort of
startscript, here named as "seedserver".
This is only a very first draft for a simple startscript (it could be done better :-))
<p>
Login as I2P user:
<ul>
<li>Place the shell-script "seedserver" in the /home/i2p/bin folder (next to i2p-tools)
<li>Make it executable: chmod u+x /home/i2p/bin/seedserver
</ul>
Update the header "# Your settings" with your individual settings.

<p>
Now you can use the shell-script:
<pre>
seedserver start
</pre>
<p>
And then (give it some seconds) take a look at the status:
<pre>
seedserver status
seedserver showlog
</pre>

<p>
Some short explanation about seedserver:
<ul>
<li>runs i2p-tools in the background
<li>creates logfiles
<li>take care of all settings
</ul>

<p>
If this is working fine, you can put the script in your personal crontab, to run it by auto-start
and to do logrotes simply by restarting it regularly once a week to avoid too big logfiles.
If you already reboot your server regularly, you can skip of course the "restart" command line.

<p>
Login as I2P user, edit your crontab:
<pre>
crontab -e
</pre>
<p>
and add these 3 lines at the end:
<pre>
@reboot /home/i2p/bin/seedserver startdelayed
04 14 * * 2 /home/i2p/bin/seedserver restart
#end
</pre>

<p>
Save and close the editor. It would be good to check if this is properly working when you reboot your machine.

<p>
"seedserver" shell script:

<h3>5. Reverse-Proxy Setup</h3>

<p>
You can run i2p-tools also behind your normal web-server (reverse-proxy).

<p>
The web-server handles the TLS handshake, encryption, SSL Certificate and the logfiles.
But you don't need the scripts su3.php and the shell cronjob for creating su3-files.
i2p-tools is running "behind" the web-server, without TLS management, only bind to
local interface 127.0.0.1 and is handling complete building and handling of su3-files.


<p>
Run i2p-tools with this command:

<pre>
i2p-tools reseed --signer test@test.de \
                 --key /path_to/test_at_test.de.pem \
                 --netdb /path_to/netDb \
                 --port=8443 \
                 --ip 127.0.0.1 \
                 --trustProxy
</pre>


Important notes for this special setup:
<ul>
<li>do *not* specify  --tlsHost, --tlsCert or --tlsKey on the command-line
<li>"ip 127.0.0.1" binds the program only to local interface
<li>"trustProxy" uses the "X-Forwarded-For" to get the real client IP
</ul>

"trustProxy" uses the "X-Forwarded-For" to get the real client IP
<p>
	nginx configuration example:
</p>
<pre>
		location / {
			proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8443;
                        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP  $remote_addr;
                        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
		}
</pre>
<p>
	Apache (untested - feedback would be appreciated)
</p>
<pre>
		ProxyRequests Off
		&lt;Proxy *&gt;
			Order deny,allow
			Allow from all
		&lt;/Proxy&gt;
		ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8443/
		ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8443/
</pre>
<p>

<p>
and for X-Forwarded-For:
<pre>
     proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP       $remote_addr;
     proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
</pre>

<p>
Additionally, ensure that your webserver uses these suggested settings for Strong SSL Security (visit <a href="https://cipherli.st/" target="_blank">CipherLi.st</a> for the latest settings). A sample configuration is provided below.
</p>
<p>

<h3>6. Convert Existing Java Keystore to crt- and pem-file</h3>

<p>
This describes how to convert your existing Java keystore with your su3 signing key to a plain crt- and pem-file.
This is only needed, when you already have a Java keystore and want to use Go solution.
If you create new keys+certs with matt's solution you can skip this chapter!

<p>
Requirements:
<ul>
<li>Java keytool
<li>openssl
<li>and of course your secret password for the keystore
</ul>

<p>
Keep in mind: the Java keystore has two passwords:
<ul>
<li>The secret key password you have entered while creating your keystore the first time (SU3File keygen ...)
<li>And a "storage" password, which is most probably default "changeit".
</ul>

<p>
This works in a Ubuntu/Debian shell:

<pre>
######################################################################################################
file="keystore.ks"
pass_jks=changeit

# List the keystore content, show the included (email) alias
keytool -list -storepass $pass_jks -keystore $file

# Convert jks --&gt; pkcs12, specify the correct email alias (xxxxx@mail.i2p):
keytool -importkeystore \
        -srcalias xxxxx@mail.i2p \
        -srckeystore $file \
        -srcstoretype jks \
        -srcstorepass $pass_jks \
        -destkeystore ${file}.p12 \
        -deststoretype pkcs12 \
        -deststorepass $pass_jks \
        -destkeypass $pass_jks

# Show the pkcs12 content:
openssl pkcs12 -passin pass:$pass_jks -in ${file}.p12 -nodes -info

# Convert pkcs12 --&gt; pem
openssl pkcs12 -passin pass:$pass_jks -in ${file}.p12 -nodes -out ${file}.pem

# Decrypt the pem
openssl rsa  -in ${file}.pem -out xxxxx_at_mail.i2p.pem

# Extract the certificate
openssl x509 -in ${file}.pem -out xxxxx_at_mail.i2p.crt

<h3>5. Seamless SSL-Certificate Exchange</h3>

<p>
The update/exchange of an already existing self-signed certificates has to be correct timed
on server *and* client side. Considering thousands of clients (many with older I2P version) the exchange
will not be seamless possible and will have very bad impact on many clients: reseed won't work for them.

<p>
To avoid this issue and make the exchange as smooth as possible follow these simple steps:

<ol>
<li>Generate a new SSL-certificate NOW, but do NOT implement it on server
<li>Send the new SSL-certificate to us to perform a roll-out towards clients NOW
<li>WAIT some month, e.g. 3-4 i2p-releases
<li>New SSL-certificate is now hopefully present on many clients (in parallel to the current/old one)
<li>THEN exchange the SSL-certificate on server
</ol>

<p>
This idea based on the fact, that you can provide in i2p/certificates/ssl more than one crt-file for a server, e.g.
server.com.crt and server.com2.crt


<h3>6. Reseed Server Domain/URL/Port Exchange</h3>


<p>
You are already operating a reseed server but want to change your Domain/URL/Port?
To make the exchange as smooth as possible for many clients please follow these steps if possible:

<ol>
<li>Setup an additional reseed instance at the new Domain/URL/Port
<li>We include the new URL into I2P source NOW and delete the old URL NOW
<li>Both of your reseed instances have to run some time in parallel
<li>WAIT some month, e.g. 3-4 i2p-releases
<li>New URL is now hopefully present on many clients
<li>THEN shutdown the old reseed instance
</ol>


<h3>7. Tests</h3>

<p>
Some simple pre-test: test the website and fetch
<pre>
	wget --user-agent="Wget/1.11.4" \
             -O /tmp/test.su3 \
             --no-check-certificate https://your-server.com:PORT/i2pseeds.su3
</pre>
Replace "PORT" with default 443 or your chosen server setting.
Inspect the fetched file.:
Some simple pre-test: test the website and fetch
<pre>
	zipinfo -z /tmp/test.su3
</pre>

<p>
Replace "--no-check-certificate" with "--ca-certificate=~/i2p/certificates/ssl/your-server.com.crt"
which contains the path to your local public SSL-certificate to check also your ssl-certificate chain.

<p>
Confirm the following:
<ul>
<li>SSL-certificate chain valid?
<li>The su3-files can be downloaded?
<li>Contains &gt; 50 dat-files?
<li>And is always the same for one client-IP?
<li>Other client-IP's gets another file?
<li>Clients has no direct access to complete folder e.g. https://your-server.com/su3/ ?
</ul>

<p>
Do a real reseed test on *another* I2P router machine:
<ul>
<li>Include manually new SSL-certificate into i2p installation:	~/i2p/certificates/ssl/
<li>Include manually new public reseed key into i2p installation:	~/i2p/certificates/reseed/
<li>http://localhost:7657/configreseed --&gt; remove all reseed hosts
<li>Add the new reseed host e.g. "https://your-server.com/" *without* trailing "i2pseeds.su3"
<li>Save and Shutdown router.
<li>Clear netdb: empty folder ./i2p/netDb.
<li>Restart I2P and watch the I2P router log:
<pre>
2014/10/13 23:01:02 | Reseed start
2014/10/13 23:01:02 | Reseeding from https://your-server/i2pseeds.su3

2014/10/13 23:01:06 | Reseed complete, xx received
</pre>
</ul>

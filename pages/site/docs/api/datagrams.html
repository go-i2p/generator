<h2>{% trans %}Datagram Overview{% endtrans %}</h2>
<p>{% trans i2cp=site_url('docs/protocol/i2cp') -%}
Datagrams build upon the base <a href="{{ i2cp }}">I2CP</a> to provide authenticated
and repliable messages in a standard format.  This lets applications reliably read
the "from" address out of a datagram and know that the address really sent the
message.  This is necessary for some applications since the base I2P message is
completely raw - it has no "from" address (unlike IP packets).  In addition, the
message and sender are authenticated by signing the payload.

<p>{% trans streaming=site_url('docs/api/streaming'),
transports=site_url('docs/transport') -%}
Datagrams, like <a href="{{ streaming }}">streaming library packets</a>,
are an application-level construct.
These protocols are independent of the low-level <a href="{{ transports }}">transports</a>;
the protocols are converted to I2NP messages by the router, and
either protocol may be carried by either transport.

sam= site_url('docs/api/sam'),

Applications written in Java may use the 
<a href="{{ url }}">datagram API</a>,
while applications in other languages 
can use <a href="{{ sam }}">SAM</a>'s datagram support.
There is also limited support in i2ptunnel in the <a href="{{ socks }}">SOCKS proxy</a>,
the 'streamr' tunnel types, and udpTunnel classes.

<h3>{% trans %}Datagram Length{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>
The application designer should carefully consider the tradeoff of repliable vs. non-repliable
datagrams. Also, the datagram size will affect reliability, due to tunnel fragmentation into 1KB
tunnel messages. The more message fragments, the more likely that one of them will be dropped
by an intermediate hop. Messages larger than a few KB are not recommended.
Over about 10 KB, the delivery probablility drops dramatically.

See the Datagrams Specification page.
{%- endtrans %}</a>


<p>
Also note that the various overheads added by lower layers, in particular
garlic messages, place a large burden on intermittent messages
such as used by a Kademlia-over-UDP application. The implementations are currently tuned
for frequent traffic using the streaming library.
</p>

<h3>{% trans %}I2CP Protocol Number and Ports{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
The standard I2CP protocol number for signed (repliable) datagrams is PROTO_DATAGRAM (17).
Applications may or may not choose to set the
protocol in the I2CP header. The default is implementation-dependent.
It must be set to demultiplex datagram and streaming traffic received on the same Destination.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans i2cp=site_url('docs/protocol/i2cp') -%}
As datagrams are not connection-oriented, the application may require
port numbers to correlate datagrams with particular peers or communications sessions,
as is traditional with UDP over IP.
Applications may add 'from' and 'to' ports to the I2CP (gzip) header as described in
the <a href="{{ i2cp }}#format">I2CP page</a>.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans i2psession='http://'+i2pconv('idk.i2p/javadoc-i2p')+'/net/i2p/client/I2PSession.html' -%}
There is no method within the datagram API to specify whether it is non-repliable (raw)
or repliable. The application should be designed to expect the appropriate type.
The I2CP protocol number or port should be used by the application to
indicate datagram type.
The I2CP protocol numbers PROTO_DATAGRAM (signed, also known as Datagram1), PROTO_DATAGRAM_RAW,
PROTO_DATAGRAM2, and PROTO_DATAGRAM3 are defined in the
<a href="{{ i2psession }}">I2PSession API</a>
for this purpose. A common design pattern in client/server datagram applications is to
use signed datagrams for a request which includes a nonce, and use a raw datagram
for the reply, returning the nonce from the request.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<p>Defaults:</p>
<ul><li>
PROTO_DATAGRAM = 17
</li><li>
PROTO_DATAGRAM_RAW = 18
</li><li>
PROTO_DATAGRAM2 = 19
</li><li>
PROTO_DATAGRAM3 = 20
</li></ul>

<p>{% trans i2psession='http://'+i2pconv('idk.i2p/javadoc-i2p')+'/net/i2p/client/I2PSession.html',
i2psessionmuxed='http://'+i2pconv('idk.i2p/javadoc-i2p')+'/net/i2p/client/I2PSessionMuxedImpl.html' -%}
The protocols and ports may be set in I2CP's
<a href="{{ i2psession }}">I2PSession API</a>,
as implemented in
<a href="{{ i2psessionmuxed }}">I2PSessionMuxedImpl</a>.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h3>{% trans %}Data Integrity{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>{% trans i2cp=site_url('docs/protocol/i2cp') -%}
Data integrity is assured by the gzip CRC-32 checksum implemented in
<a href="{{ i2cp }}#format">the I2CP layer</a>.
Authenticated datagrams (Datagram1 and Datagram2) also ensure integrity.
There is no checksum field in the datagram protocol.

<h3>{% trans %}Packet Encapsulation{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>{% trans garlicrouting=site_url('docs/how/garlic-routing'),
i2cp=site_url('docs/protocol/i2cp'),
i2np=site_url('docs/protocol/i2np'),
tunnelmessage=site_url('docs/spec/tunnel-message') -%}
Each datagram is sent through I2P as a single message (or as an individual clove in a
<a href="{{ garlicrouting }}">Garlic Message</a>).
Message encapsulation is implemented in the underlying
<a href="{{ i2cp }}">I2CP</a>,
<a href="{{ i2np }}">I2NP</a>, and
<a href="{{ tunnelmessage }}">tunnel message</a> layers.
There is no packet delimiter mechanism or length field in the datagram protocol.

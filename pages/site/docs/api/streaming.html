<h2>{% trans %}Overview{% endtrans %}</h2>

<p>{% trans datagrams=site_url('docs/spec/datagrams') -%}
The streaming library is technically part of the "application" layer,
as it is not a core router function.
In practice, however, it provides a vital function for almost all
existing I2P applications, by providing a TCP-like
streams over I2P, and allowing existing apps to be easily ported to I2P.
The other end-to-end transport library for client communication is the
<a href="{{ datagrams }}">datagram library</a>.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans i2cp=site_url('docs/protocol/i2cp') -%}
The streaming library is a layer on top of the core 
<a href="{{ i2cp }}">I2CP API</a> that allows reliable, in-order, and authenticated streams
of messages to operate across an unreliable, unordered, and unauthenticated 
message layer.  Just like the TCP to IP relationship, this streaming 
functionality has a whole series of tradeoffs and optimizations available, but
rather than embed that functionality into the base I2P code, it has been factored
off into its own library both to keep the TCP-esque complexities separate and to
allow alternative optimized implementations.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
In consideration of the relatively high cost of messages, 
the streaming library's protocol for scheduling and delivering those messages has been optimized to
allow individual messages passed to contain as much information as is available.
For instance, a small HTTP transaction proxied through the streaming library can
be completed in a single round trip - the first messages bundle a SYN, FIN, and
the small HTTP request payload, and the reply bundles the SYN,
FIN, ACK, and the HTTP response payload.  While an additional
ACK must be transmitted to tell the HTTP server that the SYN/FIN/ACK has been
received, the local HTTP proxy can often deliver the full response to the browser 
immediately.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
The streaming library bears much resemblance to an 
abstraction of TCP, with its sliding windows, congestion control algorithms
(both slow start and congestion avoidance), and general packet behavior (ACK,
SYN, FIN, RST, rto calculation, etc).  
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
The streaming library is
a robust library
which is optimized for operation over I2P.
It has a one-phase setup, and
it contains a full windowing implementation.

<h2 id="api">{% trans %}API{% endtrans %}</h2>

<p>{% trans i2cp=site_url('docs/protocol/i2cp') -%}
The streaming library API provides a standard socket paradigm to Java applications.
The lower-level <a href="{{ i2cp }}">I2CP</a> API is completely hidden, except that
applications may pass <a href="{{ i2cp }}#options">I2CP parameters</a> through the
streaming library, to be interpreted by I2CP.

The standard interface to the streaming lib is for the application to use the
<a href="{{ i2psktmf }}">I2PSocketManagerFactory</a> to create an
<a href="{{ i2psktm }}">I2PSocketManager</a>. The application then asks the
socket manager for an <a href="{{ i2psess }}">I2PSession</a>, which will cause
a connection to the router via <a href="{{ i2cp }}">I2CP</a>. The application
can then setup connections with an <a href="{{ i2pskt }}">I2PSocket</a> or
receive connections with an <a href="{{ i2psskt }}">I2PServerSocket</a>.

<a href="{{ bob }}">BOB</a>, and <a href="{{ i2ptunnel }}">I2PTunnel</a>,
may override these defaults with their own defaults.
Also note that many options only apply to servers listening for incoming connections.

<h2>{% trans %}Protocol Specification{% endtrans %}</h2>

See the Streaming Library Specification page.
{%- endtrans %}</a></p>

<h2>{% trans %}Implementation Details{% endtrans %}</h2>

<h3>{% trans %}Setup{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
The initiator sends a packet with the SYNCHRONIZE flag set. This packet may contain the initial data as well.
The peer replies with a packet with the SYNCHRONIZE flag set. This packet may contain the initial response data as well.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
The initiator may send additional data packets, up to the initial window size, before receiving the SYNCHRONIZE response.
These packets will also have the send Stream ID field set to 0.
Recipients must buffer packets received on unknown streams for a short period of time, as they may
arrive out of order, in advance of the SYNCHRONIZE packet.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h3>{% trans %}MTU Selection and Negotiation{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
The maximum message size (also called the MTU / MRU) is negotiated to the lower value supported by
the two peers. As tunnel messages are padded to 1KB, a poor MTU selection will lead to
a large amount of overhead.
The MTU is specified by the option i2p.streaming.maxMessageSize.
The current default MTU of 1730 was chosen to fit precisely into two 1K I2NP tunnel messages,
including overhead for the typical case.
{%- endtrans %}
Note: This is the maximum size of the payload only, not including the header.
</p><p>
Note: For ECIES connections, which have reduced overhead, the recommended MTU is 1812.
The default MTU remains 1730 for all connections, no matter what key type is used.
Clients must use the minimum of the sent and received MTU, as usual.
See proposal 155.
</p>


<p>{% trans -%}
The first message in a connection includes a 387 byte (typical) Destination added by the streaming layer,
and usually a 898 byte (typical) LeaseSet, and Session keys, bundled in the Garlic message by the router.
(The LeaseSet and Session Keys will not be bundled if an ElGamal Session was previously established).
Therefore, the goal of fitting a complete HTTP request in a single 1KB I2NP message is not always attainable.
However, the selection of the MTU, together with careful implementation of fragmentation
and batching strategies in the tunnel gateway processor, are important factors in network bandwidth,
latency, reliability, and efficiency, especially for long-lived connections.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h3>{% trans %}Data Integrity{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>{% trans i2cp=site_url('docs/protocol/i2cp') -%}
Data integrity is assured by the gzip CRC-32 checksum implemented in
<a href="{{ i2cp }}#format">the I2CP layer</a>.
There is no checksum field in the streaming protocol.
{%- endtrans %}</p>


<h3>{% trans %}Packet Encapsulation{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>{% trans garlicrouting=site_url('docs/how/garlic-routing'), i2cp=site_url('docs/protocol/i2cp'),
i2np=site_url('docs/protocol/i2np'), tunnelmessage=site_url('docs/spec/tunnel-message') -%}
Each packet is sent through I2P as a single message (or as an individual clove in a
<a href="{{ garlicrouting }}">Garlic Message</a>). Message encapsulation is implemented
in the underlying <a href="{{ i2cp }}">I2CP</a>, <a href="{{ i2np }}">I2NP</a>, and
<a href="{{ tunnelmessage }}">tunnel message</a> layers. There is no packet delimiter
mechanism or payload length field in the streaming protocol.
{%- endtrans %}</p>


<h3>{% trans %}Optional Delay{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
Data packets may include an optional delay field specifying the requested delay,
in ms, before the receiver should ack the packet.
Valid values are 0 to 60000 inclusive.
A value of 0 requests an immediate ack.
This is advisory only, and receivers should delay slightly so that
additional packets may be acknowledged with a single ack.
Some implementations may include an advisory value of (measured RTT / 2) in this field.
For nonzero optional delay values, receivers should limit the maximum delay
before sending an ack to a few seconds at most.
Optional delay values greater than 60000 indicate choking, see below.
{%- endtrans %}</p>


<h3>{% trans %}Receive Window and Choking{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
TCP headers include the receive window in bytes.
The streaming protocol does not contain a receive window, it uses only a simple choke/unchoke indication.
Each endpoint must maintain its own estimate of the far-end receive window, in either bytes or packets.
The recommended minimum buffer size for receiver implementations is 128 packets or 217 KB (approximately 128x1730).
Because of I2P netowrk latency, packet drops, and the resulting congestion control,
a buffer of this size is rarely filled.
Overflow is, however, likely to occur on high-bandwidth "local loopback" (same-router) connections.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<p>{% trans -%}
To quickly indicate and smoothly recover from overflow conditions,
there is a simple mechanism for pushback in the streaming protocol.
If a packet is received with an optional delay field of value of 60001 or higher,
that indicates "choking" or a receive window of zero.
A packet with an optional delay field of value of 60000 or less indicates "unchoking".
Packets without an optional delay field do not affect the choke/unchoke state.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<p>{% trans -%}
After being choked, no more packets with data should be sent until the transmitter is unchoked,
except for occasional "probe" data packets to compensate for possible lost unchoke packets.
The choked endpoint should start a "persist timer" to control the probing, as in TCP.
The unchoking endpoint should send several packets with this field set,
or continue sending them periodically until data packets are received again.
Maximum time to wait for unchoking is implementation-dependent.
Transmitter window size and congestion control strategy after being unchoked is implementation-dependent.
{%- endtrans %}</p>


<h3>{% trans %}Congestion Control{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
The streaming lib uses standard slow-start (exponential window growth) and congestion avoidance (linear window growth)
phases, with exponential backoff.
Windowing and acknowledgments use packet count, not byte count.
{%- endtrans %}</p>


<h3>{% trans %}Close{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
Any packet, including one with the SYNCHRONIZE flag set, may have the CLOSE flag sent as well.
The connection is not closed until the peer responds with the CLOSE flag.
CLOSE packets may contain data as well.
{%- endtrans %}</p>


<h3>Ping / Pong</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
There is no ping function at the I2CP layer (equivalent to ICMP echo) or in datagrams.
This function is provided in streaming.
Pings and pongs may not be combined with a standard streaming packet;
if the ECHO option is set, then
most other flags, options, ackThrough, sequenceNum, NACKs, etc. are ignored.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
A ping packet must have the ECHO, SIGNATURE_INCLUDED, and FROM_INCLUDED flags set.
The sendStreamId must be greater than zero, and the receiveStreamId is ignored.
The sendStreamId may or may not correspond to an existing connection.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
A pong packet must have the ECHO flag set.
The sendStreamId must be zero, and the receiveStreamId is the sendStreamId from the ping.
Prior to release 0.9.18, the pong packet does not include any payload that was contained in the ping.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
As of release 0.9.18, pings and pongs may contain a payload.
The payload in the ping, up to a maximum of 32 bytes, is returned in the pong.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
Streaming may be configured to disable sending pongs with the configuration i2p.streaming.answerPings=false.
{%- endtrans %}</p>



<h3 id="profile">i2p.streaming.profile Notes</h3>
<p>
This option supports two values; 1=bulk and 2=interactive.
The option provides a hint to the streaming library and/or router as to
the traffic pattern that is expected.
</p><p>
"Bulk" means to optimize for high bandwidth, possibly at the expense of latency.
This is the default.
"Interactive" means to optimize for low latency, possibly at the expense of bandwidth or efficiency.
Optimization strategies, if any, are implementation-dependent, and may include changes
outside of the streaming protocol.
</p><p>
Through API version 0.9.63, Java I2P would return an error for any value other than 1 (bulk) and the tunnel would fail to start.
As of API 0.9.64, Java I2P ignores the value.
Through API version 0.9.63, i2pd ignored this option; it is implemented in i2pd as of API 0.9.64.
</p><p>
While the streaming protocol includes a flag field to pass the profile setting to the
other end, this is not implemented in any known router.
</p>



<h3 id="sharing">{% trans %}Control Block Sharing{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
The streaming lib supports "TCP" Control Block sharing.
This shares three important streaming lib parameters
(window size, round trip time, round trip time variance)
across connections to the same remote peer.
This is used for "temporal" sharing at connection open/close time,
not "ensemble" sharing during a connection (See
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2140.txt">RFC 2140</a>).
There is a separate share per ConnectionManager (i.e. per local Destination)
so that there is no information leakage to other Destinations on the
same router.
The share data for a given peer expires after a few minutes.
The following Control Block Sharing parameters can be set per router:
{%- endtrans %}
<ul>
<li>RTT_DAMPENING = 0.75</li>
<li>RTTDEV_DAMPENING = 0.75</li>

<li>PASSIVE_FLUSH_DELAY = 175 ms
<li>Maximum RTT estimate: 60 sec
</ul>
</p>

<h3>{% trans %}History{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
The streaming library has grown organically for I2P - first mihi implemented the
"mini streaming library" as part of I2PTunnel, which was limited to a window
size of 1 message (requiring an ACK before sending the next one), and then it was
refactored out into a generic streaming interface (mirroring TCP sockets) and the
full streaming implementation was deployed with a sliding window protocol and 
optimizations to take into account the high bandwidth x delay product.  Individual
streams may adjust the maximum packet size and other options. The default
message size is selected to fit precisely in two 1K I2NP tunnel messages,
and is a reasonable tradeoff between the bandwidth costs of 
retransmitting lost messages, and the latency and overhead of multiple messages.

The behavior of the streaming library has a profound impact on
application-level performance, and as such, is an important
area for further analysis.

Additional tuning of the streaming lib parameters may be necessary.

Another area for research is the interaction of the streaming lib with the
NTCP and SSU transport layers.
See <a href="{{ ntcpdisc }}">the NTCP discussion page</a> for details.

The interaction of the routing algorithms with the streaming lib strongly affects performance.
In particular, random distribution of messages to multiple tunnels in a pool
leads to a high degree of out-of-order delivery which results in smaller window
sizes than would otherwise be the case. The router currently routes 
messages for a single from/to destination pair through a consistent set 
of tunnels, until tunnel expiration or delivery failure. The router's 
failure and tunnel selection algorithms should be reviewed for possible 
improvements.

Data is sent along unless the outbound window is full.

Probably should have a configuration option for this.

zzz has added debug code to the streaming library to log packets in a wireshark-compatible
(pcap) format; Use this to further analyze performance.
The format may require enhancement to map more streaming lib parameters to TCP fields.
{%- endtrans %}</li>
<li>{% trans -%}
There are proposals to replace the streaming lib with standard TCP
(or perhaps a null layer together with raw sockets).
This would unfortunately be incompatible with the streaming lib
but it would be good to compare the performance of the two.

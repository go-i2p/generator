<h2>Warning - Deprecated</h2>
<p>Not for use by new applications.
BOB supports the DSA-SHA1 signature type only.
BOB will not be extended to support new signature types or other advanced features.
New applications should use <a href="{{ site_url('docs/api/samv3') }}">SAM V3</a>.
</p><p>
BOB is not supported in Java I2P new installs as of release 1.7.0 (2022-02).
It will still work in Java I2P originally installed as version 1.6.1 or earlier,
even after updates, but it is unsupported and may break at any time.
BOB is still supported by i2pd as of 2022-06, but applications
should still migrate to SAMv3 for the reasons above.
</p>

<p>
At this point, most of the good ideas from BOB have been incorporated into
SAMv3, which has more features and more real-world use. BOB may still work
on some installations (see above), but it
is not gaining the advanced features available to SAMv3 and is essentially
unsupported, except by i2pd.

<p>{% trans -%}
Once set up, all TCP sockets can and will block as needed, and there is no need for any
additional messages to/from the command channel. This allows the router to pace the
stream without exploding with OOM like SAM does as it chokes on attempting to shove
many streams in or out one socket -- that can't scale when you have alot of connections!
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
What is also nice about this particular interface is that writing anything to interface
to it, is much much easier than SAM. There is no other processing to do after the set up.
It's configuration is so simple, that very simple tools, such as nc (netcat) can be used
to point to some application. The value there is that one could schedule up and down times
for an application, and not have to change the application to do that, or to even have
to stop that application. Instead, you can literally "unplug" the destination, and
"plug it in" again. As long as the same IP/port addresses and destination keys are used
when bringing the bridge up, the normal TCP application won't care, and won't notice.
It will simply be fooled -- the destinations are not reachable, and that nothing is coming in.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h2>{% trans %}Examples{% endtrans %}</h2>

<p>{% trans -%}
For the following example, we'll setup a very simple local loopback connection,
with two destinations. Destination "mouth" will be the CHARGEN service from
the INET superserver daemon. Destination "ear" will be a local port that you
can telnet into, and watch the pretty ASCII test puke forth.

Pretty cool isn't it? Try some other well known I2P SITES if you like, nonexistent ones,

<p>{% trans -%}
I won't bother to show an example of the receiver end of a bridge
because it is very simple. There are two possible settings for it, and
it is toggled with the "quiet" command.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
The default is NOT quiet, and the first data to come into your
listening socket is the destination that is making the contact. It is a
single line consisting of the BASE64 address followed by a newline.
Everything after that is for the application to actually consume.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
In quiet mode, think of it as a regular Internet connection. No
extra data comes in at all. It's just as if you are plain connected to
the regular Internet. This mode allows a form of transparency much like
is available on the router console tunnel settings pages, so that you
can use BOB to point a destination at a web server, for example, and
you would not have to modify the web server at all.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
The advantage with using BOB for this is as discussed
previously. You could schedule random uptimes for the application,
redirect to a different machine, etc. One use of this may be something
like wanting to try to goof up router-to-destination upness guessing.
You could stop and start the destination with a totally different
process to make random up and down times on services. That way you
would only be stopping the ability to contact such a service, and not
have to bother shutting it down and restarting it. You could redirect
and point to a different machine on your LAN while you do updates, or
point to a set of backup machines depending on what is running, etc,
etc. Only your imagination limits what you could do with BOB.

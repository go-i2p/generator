Following is a discussion about NTCP that took place in March 2007.
It has not been updated to reflect current implementation.
For the current NTCP specification see <a href="{{ site_url('docs/transport/ntcp') }}">the main NTCP page</a>.

<h2>NTCP vs. SSU Discussion, March 2007</h2>
<h3>NTCP questions</h3>
(adapted from an IRC discussion between zzz and cervantes)
<br />
Why is NTCP preferred over SSU, doesn't NTCP have higher overhead and latency?
It has better reliability.
<br />
Doesn't streaming lib over NTCP suffer from classic TCP-over-TCP issues?
What if we had a really simple UDP transport for streaming-lib-originated traffic?
I think SSU was meant to be the so-called really simple UDP transport - but it just proved too unreliable.

<h3>"NTCP Considered Harmful" Analysis by zzz</h3>
Posted to new Syndie, 2007-03-25.
This was posted to stimulate discussion, don't take it too seriously.
<p>
Summary: NTCP has higher latency and overhead than SSU, and is more likely to 
collapse when used with the streaming lib. However, traffic is routed with a 
preference for NTCP over SSU and this is currently hardcoded.
</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>
We currently have two transports, NTCP and SSU. As currently implemented, NTCP 
has lower "bids" than SSU so it is preferred, except for the case where there 
is an established SSU connection but no established NTCP connection for a peer.
</p><p>

SSU is similar to NTCP in that it implements acknowledgments, timeouts, and 
retransmissions. However SSU is I2P code with tight constraints on the 
timeouts and available statistics on round trip times, retransmissions, etc. 
NTCP is based on Java NIO TCP, which is a black box and presumably implements 
RFC standards, including very long maximum timeouts.
</p><p>

The majority of traffic within I2P is streaming-lib originated (HTTP, IRC, 
Bittorrent) which is our implementation of TCP. As the lower-level transport is 
generally NTCP due to the lower bids, the system is subject to the well-known 
and dreaded problem of TCP-over-TCP 
http://sites.inka.de/~W1011/devel/tcp-tcp.html , where both the higher and 
lower layers of TCP are doing retransmissions at once, leading to collapse.
</p><p>

Unlike in the PPP over SSH scenario described in the link above, we have 
several hops for the lower layer, each covered by a NTCP link. So each NTCP 
latency is generally much less than the higher-layer streaming lib latency. 
This lessens the chance of collapse.
</p><p>

Also, the probabilities of collapse are lessened when the lower-layer TCP is 
tightly constrained with low timeouts and number of retransmissions compared to 
the higher layer.
</p><p>

The .28 release increased the maximum streaming lib timeout from 10 sec to 45 
sec which greatly improved things. The SSU max timeout is 3 sec. The NTCP max 
timeout is presumably at least 60 sec, which is the RFC recommendation. There 
is no way to change NTCP parameters or monitor performance. Collapse of the 
NTCP layer is [editor: text lost]. Perhaps an external tool like tcpdump would help.
</p><p>

However, running .28, the i2psnark reported upstream does not generally stay at 
a high level. It often goes down to 3-4 KBps before climbing back up. This is a 
signal that there are still collapses.
</p><p>

SSU is also more efficient. NTCP has higher overhead and probably higher round 
trip times. when using NTCP the ratio of (tunnel output) / (i2psnark data 
output) is at least 3.5 : 1. Running an experiment where the code was modified 
to prefer SSU (the config option i2np.udp.alwaysPreferred has no effect in the 
current code), the ratio reduced to about 3 : 1, indicating better efficiency.
</p><p>

As reported by streaming lib stats, things were much improved - lifetime window 
size up from 6.3 to 7.5, RTT down from 11.5s to 10s, sends per ack down from 
1.11 to 1.07.
</p><p>

That this was quite effective was surprising, given that we were only changing 
the transport for the first of 3 to 5 total hops the outbound messages would 
take.
</p><p>

The effect on outbound i2psnark speeds wasn't clear due to normal variations. 
Also for the experiment, inbound NTCP was disabled. The effect on inbound 
speeds on i2psnark was not clear.
</p>
<h4>Proposals</h4>

<ul>
<li>
1A)
This is easy -
We should flip the bid priorities so that SSU is preferred for all traffic, if 
we can do this without causing all sorts of other trouble. This will fix the 
i2np.udp.alwaysPreferred configuration option so that it works (either as true 
or false).

<li>
1B)
Alternative to 1A), not so easy -
If we can mark traffic without adversely affecting our anonymity goals, we 
should identify streaming-lib generated traffic and have SSU generate a low bid 
for that traffic. This tag will have to go with the message through each hop
so that the forwarding routers also honor the SSU preference.


<li>
2)
Bounding SSU even further (reducing maximum retransmissions from the current 
10) is probably wise to reduce the chance of collapse.

<li>
3)
We need further study on the benefits vs. harm of a semi-reliable protocol 
underneath the streaming lib. Are retransmissions over a single hop beneficial 
and a big win or are they worse than useless?
We could do a new SUU (secure unreliable UDP) but probably not worth it. We 
could perhaps add a no-ack-required message type in SSU if we don't want any 
retransmissions at all of streaming-lib traffic. Are tightly bounded 
retransmissions desirable?

<li>
4)
The priority sending code in .28 is only for NTCP. So far my testing hasn't 
shown much use for SSU priority as the messages don't queue up long enough for 
priorities to do any good. But more testing needed.

<li>
5)
The new streaming lib max timeout of 45s is probably still too low.
The TCP RFC says 60s. It probably shouldn't be shorter than the underlying NTCP max timeout (presumably 60s).
</ul>

<p>
On the whole, I'm open to experimenting with this, though remember why NTCP is 
there in the first place - SSU failed in a congestion collapse. NTCP "just 
works", and while 2-10&#37; retransmission rates can be handled in normal 
single-hop networks, that gives us a 40&#37; retransmission rate with 2 hop 
tunnels. If you loop in some of the measured SSU retransmission rates we saw 
back before NTCP was implemented (10-30+&#37;), that gives us an 83&#37; retransmission 
rate. Perhaps those rates were caused by the low 10 second timeout, but 
increasing that much would bite us (remember, multiply by 5 and you've got half 
the journey).
</p><p>

Unlike TCP, we have no feedback from the tunnel to know whether the message 
made it - there are no tunnel level acks. We do have end to end ACKs, but only 
on a small number of messages (whenever we distribute new session tags) - out 
of the 1,553,591 client messages my router sent, we only attempted to ACK 
145,207 of them. The others may have failed silently or succeeded perfectly.
</p><p>

I'm not convinced by the TCP-over-TCP argument for us, especially split across 
the various paths we transfer down. Measurements on I2P can convince me 
otherwise, of course.
</p><p>

performance.

</p><p>


True, but net connections only get up to that level when something really bad 
is going on - the retransmission timeout on TCP is often on the order of tens 
or hundreds of milliseconds. As foofighter points out, they've got 20+ years 
experience and bugfixing in their TCP stacks, plus a billion dollar industry 
optimizing hardware and software to perform well according to whatever it is 
they do.
</p><p>

This is very interesting data, though more as a matter of router congestion 
than bandwidth efficiency - you'd have to compare 3.5*$n*$NTCPRetransmissionPct 
./. 3.0*$n*$SSURetransmissionPct. This data point suggests there's something in 
the router that leads to excess local queuing of messages already being 
transferred.
</p><p>

<i>
lifetime window size up from 6.3 to 7.5, RTT down from 11.5s to 10s, sends per 
ACK down from 1.11 to 1.07.
</i>

</p><p>

Remember that the sends-per-ACK is only a sample not a full count (as we don't 
try to ACK every send). Its not a random sample either, but instead samples 
more heavily periods of inactivity or the initiation of a burst of activity - 
sustained load won't require many ACKs.
</p><p>

Window sizes in that range are still woefully low to get the real benefit of 
AIMD, and still too low to transmit a single 32KB BT chunk (increasing the 
floor to 10 or 12 would cover that).
</p><p>

Still, the wsize stat looks promising - over how long was that maintained?
</p><p>

Actually, for testing purposes, you may want to look at 
StreamSinkClient/StreamSinkServer or even TestSwarm in 
apps/ministreaming/java/src/net/i2p/client/streaming/ - StreamSinkClient is a 
CLI app that sends a selected file to a selected destination and 
StreamSinkServer creates a destination and writes out any data sent to it 
(displaying size and transfer time). TestSwarm combines the two - flooding 
random data to whomever it connects to. That should give you the tools to 
measure sustained throughput capacity over the streaming lib, as opposed to BT 
choke/send.
</p><p>

or false).
</i>
</p><p>


Honoring i2np.udp.alwaysPreferred is a good idea in any case - please feel free 
to commit that change. Lets gather a bit more data though before switching the 
preferences, as NTCP was added to deal with an SSU-created congestion collapse.
</p><p>

</i>
</p><p>


In practice, there are three types of traffic - tunnel building/testing, netDb 
query/response, and streaming lib traffic. The network has been designed to 
make differentiating those three very hard.

</p><p>

<i>
2)
Bounding SSU even further (reducing maximum retransmissions from the current 
10) is probably wise to reduce the chance of collapse.
</i>
</p><p>


At 10 retransmissions, we're up shit creek already, I agree. One, maybe two 
retransmissions is reasonable, from a transport layer, but if the other side is 
too congested to ACK in time (even with the implemented SACK/NACK capability), 
there's not much we can do.
</p><p>

In my view, to really address the core issue we need to address why the router 
gets so congested to ACK in time (which, from what I've found, is due to CPU 
contention). Maybe we can juggle some things in the router's processing to make 
the transmission of an already existing tunnel higher CPU priority than 
decrypting a new tunnel request? Though we've got to be careful to avoid 
starvation.
</p><p>

</p><p>

Worth looking into - what if we just disabled SSU's retransmissions? It'd 
probably lead to much higher streaming lib resend rates, but maybe not.
</p><p>

</i>

</p><p>

There's UDPTransport.PRIORITY_LIMITS and UDPTransport.PRIORITY_WEIGHT (honored 
by TimedWeightedPriorityMessageQueue), but currently the weights are almost all 
equal, so there's no effect. That could be adjusted, of course (but as you 
mention, if there's no queuing, it doesn't matter).
</p><p>

<i>
5)
The new streaming lib max timeout of 45s is probably still too low. The TCP RFC 
says 60s. It probably shouldn't be shorter than the underlying NTCP max timeout 
(presumably 60s).
</i>
</p><p>


That 45s is the max retransmission timeout of the streaming lib though, not the 
stream timeout. TCP in practice has retransmission timeouts orders of magnitude 
less, though yes, can get to 60s on links running through exposed wires or 
satellite transmissions ;) If we increase the streaming lib retransmission 
timeout to e.g. 75 seconds, we could go get a beer before a web page loads 
(especially assuming less than a 98&#37; reliable transport). That's one reason we 
prefer NTCP.

</p><p>

One of my main stats-gathering techniques is turning on 
net.i2p.client.streaming.ConnectionPacketHandler=DEBUG and watching the RTT 
times and window sizes as they go by. To overgeneralize for a moment, it's 
common to see 3 types of connections: ~4s RTT, ~10s RTT, and ~30s RTT. Trying 
to knock down the 30s RTT connections is the goal. If CPU contention is the 
cause then maybe some juggling will do it.
</p><p>

Reducing the SSU max retrans from 10 is really just a stab in the dark as we 
don't have good data on whether we are collapsing, having TCP-over-TCP issues, 
or what, so more data is needed.
</p><p>

<i>

</p><p>

What I don't understand, if you could elaborate, are the benefits of SSU 
retransmissions for non-streaming-lib traffic. Do we need tunnel messages (for 
example) to use a semi-reliable transport or can they use an unreliable or 
kinda-sorta-reliable transport (1 or 2 retransmissions max, for example)? In 
other words, why semi-reliability?
</p><p>

<i>
(but as you mention, if there's no queuing, it doesn't matter).
</i>
</p><p>

I implemented priority sending for UDP but it kicked in about 100,000 times 
less often than the code on the NTCP side. Maybe that's a clue for further 
investigation or a hint - I don't understand why it would back up that much 
more often on NTCP, but maybe that's a hint on why NTCP performs worse.

</p>

<h3>Question answered by jrandom</h3>
Posted to new Syndie, 2007-03-31
<p>
measured SSU retransmission rates we saw back before NTCP was implemented 
(10-30+&#37;)
</p><p>

Can the router itself measure this? If so, could a transport be selected based 
on measured performance? (i.e. if an SSU connection to a peer is dropping an 
unreasonable number of messages, prefer NTCP when sending to that peer)
</p><p>



Yeah, it currently uses that stat right now as a poor-man's MTU detection (if 
the retransmission rate is high, it uses the small packet size, but if its low, 
it uses the large packet size). We tried a few things when first introducing 
NTCP (and when first moving away from the original TCP transport) that would 
prefer SSU but fail that transport for a peer easily, causing it to fall back 
on NTCP. However, there's certainly more that could be done in that regard, 
though it gets complicated quickly (how/when to adjust/reset the bids, whether 
to share these preferences across multiple peers or not, whether to share it 
across multiple sessions with the same peer (and for how long), etc).

If I've understood things right, the primary reason in favor of TCP (in 
general, both the old and new variety) was that you needn't worry about coding 
a good TCP stack. Which ain't impossibly hard to get right... just that 
existing TCP stacks have a 20 year lead.
</p><p>

AFAIK, there hasn't been much deep theory behind the preference of TCP versus 
UDP, except the following considerations:

<ul>
<li>
 A TCP-only network is very dependent on reachable peers (those who can forward 
incoming connections through their NAT)
<li>
 Still even if reachable peers are rare, having them be high capacity somewhat 
alleviates the topological scarcity issues
<li>
 UDP allows for "NAT hole punching" which lets people be "kind of 
pseudo-reachable" (with the help of introducers) who could otherwise only 
connect out
<li>
 The "old" TCP transport implementation required lots of threads, which was a 
performance killer, while the "new" TCP transport does well with few threads
<li>
 Routers of set A crap out when saturated with UDP. Routers of set B crap out 
when saturated with TCP.
<li>
 It "feels" (as in, there are some indications but no scientific data or 
quality statistics) that A is more widely deployed than B
<li>
 Some networks carry non-DNS UDP datagrams with an outright shitty quality, 
while still somewhat bothering to carry TCP streams.
</ul>
</p><p>


On that background, a small diversity of transports (as many as needed, but not 
more) appears sensible in either case. Which should be the main transport, 
depends on their performance-wise. I've seen nasty stuff on my line when I 
tried to use its full capacity with UDP. Packet losses on the level of 35&#37;.
</p><p>

We could definitely try playing with UDP versus TCP priorities, but I'd urge 
caution in that. I would urge that they not be changed too radically all at 
once, or it might break things.

</p><p>

These are all valid issues. However you are considering the two protocols in 
isolation, whether than thinking about what transport protocol is best for a 
particular higher-level protocol (i.e. streaming lib or not).
</p><p>

What I'm saying is you have to take the streaming lib into consideration.

So either shift the preferences for everybody or treat streaming lib traffic 
differently.

That's what my proposal 1B) is talking about - have a different preference for 
streaming-lib traffic than for non streaming-lib traffic (for example tunnel 
build messages).
</p><p>

</p><p>

Agreed. The new .28 may have made things better for packet loss over UDP, or 
maybe not.

One important point - the transport code does remember failures of a transport. 
So if UDP is the preferred transport, it will try it first, but if it fails for 
a particular destination, the next attempt for that destination it will try 
NTCP rather than trying UDP again.
</p><p>

<i>

</i>
</p><p>

We have four tuning knobs - the four bid values (SSU and NTCP, for 
already-connected and not-already-connected).
We could make SSU be preferred over NTCP only if both are connected, for 
example, but try NTCP first if neither transport is connected.
</p><p>

The other way to do it gradually is only shifting the streaming lib traffic 
(the 1B proposal) however that could be hard and may have anonymity 
implications, I don't know. Or maybe shift the traffic only for the first 
outbound hop (i.e. don't propagate the flag to the next router), which gives 
you only partial benefit but might be more anonymous and easier.
</p>

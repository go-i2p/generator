<p>{% trans -%}
The I2P Client Protocol (I2CP) exposes a strong separation of concerns between
the router and any client that wishes to communicate over the network.  It enables
secure and asynchronous messaging by sending and receiving messages over a 
single TCP socket.
With I2CP, a client application tells the
router who they are (their "destination"), what anonymity, reliability, and 
latency tradeoffs to make, and where to send messages.  In turn the router uses
I2CP to tell the client when any messages have arrived, and to request authorization
for some tunnels to be used.

streaming=site_url('docs/api/streaming') -%}
The protocol itself is implemented in Java, to provide the
<a href="{{ url }}">Client SDK</a>.
This SDK is exposed in the i2p.jar package, which implements the client-side of I2CP.
Clients should never need to access the router.jar package, which contains the
router itself and the router-side of I2CP.
There is also a <a href="{{ libi2cp }}">C library implementation</a>.
A non-Java client would also have to implement the
<a href="{{ streaming }}">streaming library</a> for TCP-style connections.

<p>{% trans streaming=site_url('docs/api/streaming'), datagrams=site_url('docs/spec/datagrams'),

Applications can take advantage of the base I2CP plus the 
<a href="{{ streaming }}">streaming</a> and <a href="{{ datagrams }}">datagram</a> libraries
by using the <a href="{{ sam }}">Simple Anonymous Messaging</a> or <a href="{{ bob }}">BOB</a> protocols,
which do not require clients to deal with any sort of cryptography.
Also, clients may access the network by one of several proxies -
HTTP, CONNECT, and SOCKS 4/4a/5.
Alternatively, Java clients may access those libraries in ministreaming.jar and streaming.jar.
So there are several options for both Java and non-Java applications.

Client-side end-to-end encryption (encrypting the data over the I2CP connection)
was disabled in I2P release 0.6,
leaving in place the <a href="{{ elgamalaes }}">ElGamal/AES end-to-end encryption</a>
which is implemented in the router.
The only cryptography that client libraries must still implement is
<a href="{{ cryptography }}#DSA">DSA public/private key signing</a>
for <a href="{{ i2cp }}#msg_CreateLeaseSet">LeaseSets</a> and
<a href="{{ i2cp }}#struct_SessionConfig">Session Configurations</a>, and management of those keys.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
In a standard I2P installation, port 7654 is used by external java clients to communicate
with the local router via I2CP.
By default, the router binds to address 127.0.0.1. To bind to 0.0.0.0, set the
router advanced configuration option <tt>i2cp.tcp.bindAllInterfaces=true</tt> and restart.
Clients in the same JVM as the router pass messages directly to the router
through an internal JVM interface.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans commonstructures=site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') -%}
Some router and client implementations may also support external connections over SSL,
as configured by the i2cp.SSL=true option.
While SSL is not the default, it is strongly recommended for any traffic that may
be exposed to the open Internet. The authorization user/password (if any), the
<a href="{{ commonstructures }}#type_PrivateKey">Private Key</a> and
<a href="{{ commonstructures }}#type_SigningPrivateKey">Signing Private Key</a> for the
<a href="{{ commonstructures }}#struct_Destination">Destination</a>
are all transmitted in-the-clear unless SSL is enabled.
Some router and client implementations may also support external connections over domain sockets.

<p>{% trans i2cp=site_url('docs/spec/i2cp') -%}
When a client connects to the router, it first sends a single protocol version byte (0x2A).
Then it sends a <a href="{{ i2cp }}#msg_GetDate">GetDate Message</a> and waits for the <a href="{{ i2cp }}#msg_SetDate">SetDate Message</a> response.
Next, it sends a <a href="{{ i2cp }}#msg_CreateSession">CreateSession Message</a> containing the session configuration.
It next awaits a <a href="{{ i2cp }}#msg_RequestLeaseSet">RequestLeaseSet Message</a> from the router, indicating that inbound tunnels
have been built, and responds with a CreateLeaseSetMessage containing the signed LeaseSet.
The client may now initiate or receive connections from other I2P destinations.

Setting to "false" may save significant outbound bandwidth, especially if

LeaseSet is published, client is a "server", all connections are inbound
so the connecting far-end destination obviously has the leaseset already.

connection to temporarily increase while the other end re-fetches the LeaseSet
after expiration.

<h2 id="format">{% trans %}I2CP Payload Data Format and Multiplexing{% endtrans %}</h2>
<p>{% trans i2cp=site_url('docs/spec/i2cp') -%}
The end-to-end messages handled by I2CP (i.e. the data sent by the client in a
<a href="{{ i2cp }}#msg_SendMessage">SendMessageMessage</a>
and received by the client in a
<a href="{{ i2cp }}#msg_MessagePayload">MessagePayloadMessage</a>)
are gzipped with a standard 10-byte gzip
header beginning with 0x1F 0x8B 0x08 as
specified by <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt">RFC 1952</a>.
As of release 0.7.1, I2P uses ignored portions of the gzip header to include
protocol, from-port, and to-port information, thus supporting streaming and
datagrams on the same destination, and allowing query/response using datagrams
to work reliably in the presence of multiple channels.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
The gzip function cannot be completely turned off, however setting i2cp.gzip=false
turns the gzip effort setting to 0, which may save a little CPU.
{%- endtrans %}
Implementations may select different gzip efforts on a per-socket or
per-message basis, depending on an assessment of the compressibility
of the contents. Due to the compressibility of destination padding implemented in
API 0.9.57 (proposal 161), compression of the streaming SYN packets
in each direction, and of repliable datagrams, is recommended even if
the payload is not compressible.
Implementations may wish to write a trivial gzip/gunzip function for
a gzip effort of 0, which will provide large efficiency gains
over a gzip library for this case.

<h2>Important Differences from Standard IP</h2>
<p>
I2CP ports are for I2P sockets and datagrams. They are unrelated to your local sockets or ports.
Because I2P did not support ports and protocol numbers prior to release 0.7.1,
ports and protocol numbers are somewhat different from that in standard IP,
for backward compatibility:
</p>

<ul><li>
Port 0 is valid and has special meaning.
</li><li>
Ports 1-1023 are not special or privileged.
</li><li>
Servers listen on port 0 by default, which means "all ports".
</li><li>
Clients send to port 0 by default, which means "any port".
</li><li>
Clients send from port 0 by default, which means "unspecified".
</li><li>
Servers may have a service listening on port 0 and other services listening on higher ports.
If so, the port 0 service is the default, and will be connected to if the incoming
socket or datagram port does not match another service.
</li><li>
Most I2P destinations only have one service running on them, so you may use the defaults, and ignore I2CP port configuration.
</li><li>
Protocol 0 is valid and means "any protocol". However, this is not recommended, and probably will not work.
Streaming requires that the protocol number is set to 6.
</li><li>
Streaming sockets are tracked by an internal connection ID.
Therefore, there is no requirement that the 5-tuple of dest:port:dest:port:protocol be unique.
For example, there may be multiple sockets with the same ports between two destinations.
Clients do not need to pick a "free port" for an outbound connection.
</li></ul>

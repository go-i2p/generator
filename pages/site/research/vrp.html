<p>{% trans %}Researchers: during your study and network testing, we ask that you refrain from the following: - Performing active exploits or Denial of Service attacks on the
I2P network - Performing social engineering on I2P team and community members - Performing any physical or electronic attempts against I2P property and/or data

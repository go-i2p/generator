This table lists often-used terminology when discussing I2P and cryptography.

<table>
    <ul>
        <li>{% trans -%}I2P: Invisible Internet Project: a project meant to
        provide an anonymity layer, so user can communicate anonymously using a
        range of applications.{%- endtrans %}</li>
        <li>{% trans -%}Router: The core I2P software, which routes encrypted
        packets on the I2P network. All routers by default participate in the
        network, which both helps the network and provides cover traffic for any
        clients or servers connecting to the I2P network through the
        router.{%- endtrans %}</li>
        <li>{% trans -%}RouterIdentity: A collection of information required to
        communicate directly with a router, such as its IP address and listening
        port, public signing and encryption keys etc.{%- endtrans %}</li>
        <li>{% trans -%}Tunnel: An anonymous communication pathway between a
        client or server and the I2P network. Tunnels are unidirectional, so any
        one client or server must have at least two Tunnels - one for inbound
        traffic and one for outbound traffic.{%- endtrans %}</li>
        <li>{% trans -%}Destination: The cryptographic identity of a tunnel.
        These are the identities of clients and servers within the I2P network,
        and are analogous to the IP:port of a computer on the normal
        internet.{%- endtrans %}</li>
        <li>{% trans -%}LeaseSet: A collection of information required to
        communicate with a client or server at a particular Destination, such as
        the gateways of the inbound Tunnels for that
        Destination.{%- endtrans %}</li>

<table>
    <ul>
        <li>{% trans -%}Decentralization: Network architecture that avoids
        reliance on a single party. Encompasses peer-to-peer, blockchain,
        federated, and distributed technologies that involve many individual
        users.{%- endtrans %}</li>
        <li>{% trans -%}Peer-to-Peer (p2p): Peers make a portion of their 
        resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth,
        directly available to other network participants, without the need for
        central coordination by servers or stable hosts. Popularized by
        BitTorrent, Napster, and Bitcoin.{%- endtrans %}</li>
        <li>{% trans -%}Federated: Federation allows separate deployments of a
        service to communicate with each other through a common protocol, for
        instance a mail server run by Google federates with a mail server run by
        Microsoft when you send an email from @gmail.com to @hotmail.com.
        Each deployment may host multiple users.{%- endtrans %}</li>
        <li>{% trans -%}Blockchain: A distributed ledger that can record
        transactions between multiple parties efficiently and in a verifiable
        and permanent way.{%- endtrans %}</li>
        <li>{% trans -%}Distributed systems: Academic topic within the
        discipline of Computer Science which is concerned with the design of
        computer systems that consist of many individual computers connected
        over a network. Peer-to-peer networks and blockchains are examples of
        distributed systems architectures.{%- endtrans %}</li>
        <li>{% trans -%}TCP/UDP: The two foundational transport protocols used
        on the Internet. Common protocols used to send data between two
        computers.{%- endtrans %}</li>
        <li>{% trans -%}DHT: Distributed hash table, used in some projects to
        connect peers to each other by storing information in the form of
        key-value pairs in a distributed manner.{%- endtrans %}</li>
        <li>{% trans -%}IP address: A number of a computer or network which is
        unique and thus can be used to address it.{%- endtrans %}</li>
        <li>{% trans -%}WebRTC: A protocol standard for establishing connections
        in a web browser where data passes directly between
        users.{%- endtrans %}</li>
        <li>{% trans -%}Hash: A number, usually displayed as a string of letters
        and numbers. It can serve as a ‘fingerprint’ uniquely identifying
        data.{%- endtrans %}</li>
        <li>{% trans -%}UX: User experience, the overall experience of a person
        using a product or a service, especially in terms of how easy it is to
        use.{%- endtrans %}</li>

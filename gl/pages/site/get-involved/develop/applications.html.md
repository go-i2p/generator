## Why write I2P-specific code? {#why}

There are multiple ways to use applications in I2P. Using
[I2PTunnel](), you can use regular
applications without needing to program explicit I2P support. This is
very effective for client-server scenario\'s, where you need to connect
to a single website. You can simply create a tunnel using I2PTunnel to
connect to that website, as shown in [Figure 1](#tunnel.serverclient).

If your application is distributed, it will require connections to a
large amount of peers. Using I2PTunnel, you will need to create a new
tunnel for each peer you want to contact, as shown in [Figure
2](#tunnel.peertopeer). This process can of course be automated, but
running a lot of I2PTunnel instances creates a large amount of overhead.
In addition, with many protocols you will need to force everyone to use
the same set of ports for all peers - e.g. if you want to reliably run
DCC chat, everyone needs to agree that port 10001 is Alice, port 10002
is Bob, port 10003 is Charlie, and so on, since the protocol includes
TCP/IP specific information (host and port).

General network applications often send a lot of additional data that
could be used to identify users. Hostnames, port numbers, time zones,
character sets, etc. are often sent without informing the user. As such,
designing the network protocol specifically with anonymity in mind can
avoid compromising user identities.

There are also efficiency considerations to review when determining how
to interact on top of I2P. The streaming library and things built on top
of it operate with handshakes similar to TCP, while the core I2P
protocols (I2NP and I2CP) are strictly message based (like UDP or in
some instances raw IP). The important distinction is that with I2P,
communication is operating over a long fat network - each end to end
message will have nontrivial latencies, but may contain payloads of up
to several KB. An application that needs a simple request and response
can get rid of any state and drop the latency incurred by the startup
and teardown handshakes by using (best effort) datagrams without having
to worry about MTU detection or fragmentation of messages.

In summary, a number of reasons to write I2P-specific code:

- Creating a large amount of I2PTunnel instances consumes a
 non-trivial amount of resources, which is problematic for
 distributed applications (a new tunnel is required for each peer).
- General network protocols often send a lot of additional data that
 can be used to identify users. Programming specifically for I2P
 allows the creation of a network protocol that does not leak such
 information, keeping users anonymous and secure.
- Network protocols designed for use on the regular internet can be
 inefficient on I2P, which is a network with a much higher latency.

I2P supports a standard [plugins interface]()
for developers so that applications may be easily integrated and
distributed.

Applications written in Java and accessible/runnable using an HTML
interface via the standard webapps/app.war may be considered for
inclusion in the i2p distribution.

## Important concepts {#concepts}

There are a few changes that require adjusting to when using I2P:

### Destination \~= host+port

An application running on I2P sends messages from and receives messages
to a unique cryptographically secure end point - a \"destination\". In
TCP or UDP terms, a destination could (largely) be considered the
equivalent of a hostname plus port number pair, though there are a few
differences.

- An I2P destination itself is a cryptographic construct - all data
 sent to one is encrypted as if there were universal deployment of
 IPsec with the (anonymized) location of the end point signed as if
 there were universal deployment of DNSSEC.

- I2P destinations are mobile identifiers - they can be moved from one
 I2P router to another (or it can even \"multihome\" - operate on
 multiple routers at once). This is quite different from the TCP or
 UDP world where a single end point (port) must stay on a single
 host.

- I2P destinations are ugly and large - behind the scenes, they
 contain a 2048 bit ElGamal public key for encryption, a 1024 bit DSA
 public key for signing, and a variable size certificate, which may
 contain proof of work or blinded data.

 There are existing ways to refer to these large and ugly
 destinations by short and pretty names (e.g. \"irc.duck.i2p\"), but
 those techniques do not guarantee globally uniqueness (since
 they\'re stored locally in a database on each person\'s machine) and
 the current mechanism is not especially scalable nor secure (updates
 to the host list are managed using \"subscriptions\" to naming
 services). There may be some secure, human readable, scalable, and
 globally unique, naming system some day, but applications shouldn\'t
 depend upon it being in place, since there are those who don\'t
 think such a beast is possible. [Further information on the naming
 system]() is available.

While most applications do not need to distinguish protocols and ports,
I2P *does* support them. Complex applications may specify a protocol,
from port, and to port, on a per-message basis, to multiplex traffic on
a single destination. See the [datagram
page]() for details. Simple applications
operate by listening for \"all protocols\" on \"all ports\" of a
destination.

### Anonymity and confidentiality

I2P has transparent end to end encryption and authentication for all
data passed over the network - if Bob sends to Alice\'s destination,
only Alice\'s destination can receive it, and if Bob is using the
datagrams or streaming library, Alice knows for certain that Bob\'s
destination is the one who sent the data.

Of course, I2P transparently anonymizes the data sent between Alice and
Bob, but it does nothing to anonymize the content of what they send. For
instance, if Alice sends Bob a form with her full name, government IDs,
and credit card numbers, there is nothing I2P can do. As such, protocols
and applications should keep in mind what information they are trying to
protect and what information they are willing to expose.

### I2P datagrams can be up to several KB

Applications that use I2P datagrams (either raw or repliable ones) can
essentially be thought of in terms of UDP - the datagrams are unordered,
best effort, and connectionless - but unlike UDP, applications don\'t
need to worry about MTU detection and can simply fire off large
datagrams. While the upper limit is nominally 32 KB, the message is
fragmented for transport, thus dropping the reliability of the whole.
Datagrams over about 10 KB are not currently recommended. See the
[datagram page]() for details. For many
applications, 10 KB of data is sufficient for an entire request or
response, allowing them to transparently operate in I2P as a UDP-like
application without having to write fragmentation, resends, etc.

## Development options {#options}

There are several means of sending data over I2P, each with their own
pros and cons. The streaming lib is the recommended interface, used by
the majority of I2P applications.

### Streaming Lib

The [full streaming library]() is now the
standard interface. It allows programming using TCP-like sockets, as
explained in the [Streaming development guide](#start.streaming).

### BOB

BOB is the [Basic Open Bridge](), allowing an
application in any language to make streaming connections to and from
I2P. At this point in time it lacks UDP support, but UDP support is
planned in the near future. BOB also contains several tools, such as
destination key generation, and verification that an address conforms to
I2P specifications. Up to date info and applications that use BOB can be
found at this [I2P Site](http:///).

### SAM, SAM V2, SAM V3

*SAM is not recommended. SAM V2 is okay, SAM V3 is recommended.*

SAM is the [Simple Anonymous Messaging]() protocol,
allowing an application written in any language to talk to a SAM bridge
through a plain TCP socket and have that bridge multiplex all of its I2P
traffic, transparently coordinating the encryption/decryption and event
based handling. SAM supports three styles of operation:

- streams, for when Alice and Bob want to send data to each other
 reliably and in order
- repliable datagrams, for when Alice wants to send Bob a message that
 Bob can reply to
- raw datagrams, for when Alice wants to squeeze the most bandwidth
 and performance as possible, and Bob doesn\'t care whether the
 data\'s sender is authenticated or not (e.g. the data transferred is
 self authenticating)

SAM V3 aims at the same goal as SAM and SAM V2, but does not require
multiplexing/demultiplexing. Each I2P stream is handled by its own
socket between the application and the SAM bridge. Besides, datagrams
can be sent and received by the application through datagram
communications with the SAM bridge.

[SAM V2]() is a new version used by imule that
fixes some of the problems in [SAM]().\
[SAM V3]() is used by imule since version 1.4.0.

### I2PTunnel

The I2PTunnel application allows applications to build specific TCP-like
tunnels to peers by creating either I2PTunnel \'client\' applications
(which listen on a specific port and connect to a specific I2P
destination whenever a socket to that port is opened) or I2PTunnel
\'server\' applications (which listen to a specific I2P destination and
whenever it gets a new I2P connection it outproxies to a specific TCP
host/port). These streams are 8-bit clean, and are authenticated and
secured through the same streaming library that SAM uses, but there is a
nontrivial overhead involved with creating multiple unique I2PTunnel
instances, since each have their own unique I2P destination and their
own set of tunnels, keys, etc.

### SOCKS

I2P supports a SOCKS V4 and V5 proxy. Outbound connections work well.
Inbound (server) and UDP functionality may be incomplete and untested.

### Ministreaming

*Removed*

There used to be a simple \"ministreaming\" library, but now
ministreaming.jar contains only the interfaces for the full streaming
library.

### Datagrams

*Recommended for UDP-like applications*

The [Datagram library]() allows sending
UDP-like packets. It\'s possible to use:

- Repliable datagrams
- Raw datagrams

### I2CP

*Not recommended*

[I2CP]() itself is a language independent
protocol, but to implement an I2CP library in something other than Java
there is a significant amount of code to be written (encryption
routines, object marshalling, asynchronous message handling, etc). While
someone could write an I2CP library in C or something else, it would
most likely be more useful to use the C SAM library instead.

### Web Applications

I2P comes with the Jetty webserver, and configuring to use the Apache
server instead is straightforward. Any standard web app technology
should work.

## Start developing - a simple guide {#start}

Developing using I2P requires a working I2P installation and a
development environment of your own choice. If you are using Java, you
can start development with the [streaming library](#start.streaming) or
datagram library. Using another programming language, SAM or BOB can be
used.

### Developing with the streaming library {#start.streaming}

The following example shows how to create TCP-like client and server
applications using the streaming library.

This will require the following libraries in your classpath:

- \$I2P/lib/streaming.jar: The streaming library itself
- \$I2P/lib/mstreaming.jar: Factory and interfaces for the streaming
 library
- \$I2P/lib/i2p.jar: Standard I2P classes, data structures, API, and
 utilities

You can fetch these from an I2P installation, or add the following
dependencies from Maven Central:

- ``
- ``

Network communication requires the usage of I2P network sockets. To
demonstrate this, we will create an application where a client can send
text messages to a server, who will print the messages and send them
back to the client. In other words, the server will function as an echo.

We will start by initializing the server application. This requires
getting an I2PSocketManager and creating an I2PServerSocket. We will not
provide the I2PSocketManagerFactory with the saved keys for an existing
Destination, so it will create a new Destination for us. So we will ask
the I2PSocketManager for an I2PSession, so we can find out the
Destination that was created, as we will need to copy and paste that
information later so the client can connect to us.

public static void main(String\[\] args) { //Initialize application
I2PSocketManager manager = I2PSocketManagerFactory.createManager();
I2PServerSocket serverSocket = manager.getServerSocket(); I2PSession
session = manager.getSession(); //Print the base64 string, the regular
string would look like garbage.
System.out.println(session.getMyDestination().toBase64()); //The
additional main method code comes here\... } } 

Code example 1: initializing the server application.
:::

Once we have an I2PServerSocket, we can create I2PSocket instances to
accept connections from clients. In this example, we will create a
single I2PSocket instance, that can only handle one client at a time. A
real server would have to be able to handle multiple clients. To do
this, multiple I2PSocket instances would have to be created, each in
separate threads. Once we have created the I2PSocket instance, we read
data, print it and send it back to the client. The bold code is the new
code we add.

this.socket = socket; } public void run() { while(true) { try {
I2PSocket sock = this.socket.accept(); if(sock != null) { //Receive from

InputStreamReader(sock.getInputStream())); //Send to clients
BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new
OutputStreamWriter(sock.getOutputStream())); String line =
br.readLine(); if(line != null) { System.out.println(\"Received from

System.out.println(\"General I2P exception!\"); } catch

catch (SocketTimeoutException ex) { System.out.println(\"Timeout!\"); }
catch (IOException ex) { System.out.println(\"General
read/write-exception!\"); } } } private I2PServerSocket socket; } } 

Code example 2: accepting connections from clients and handling
messages.
:::

When you run the above server code, it should print something like this
(but without the line endings, it should just be one huge block of
characters):

``` {#start.streaming.destination}

```

This is the base64-representation of the server Destination. The client
will need this string to reach the server.

Now, we will create the client application. Again, a number of steps are
required for initialization. Again, we will need to start by getting an
I2PSocketManager. We won\'t use an I2PSession and an I2PServerSocket
this time. Instead, we will use the server Destination string to start
our connection. We will ask the user for the Destination string, and
create an I2PSocket using this string. Once we have an I2PSocket, we can
start sending and receiving data to and from the server.

Code example 3: starting the client and connecting it to the server
application.
:::

Finally, you can run both the server and the client application. First,
start the server application. It will print a Destination string (like
shown [above](#start.streaming.destination)). Next, start the client
application. When it requests a Destination string, you can enter the
string printed by the server. The client will then send \'Hello I2P!\'
(along with a newline) to the server, who will print the message and
send it back to the client.

Congratulations, you have successfully communicated over I2P!

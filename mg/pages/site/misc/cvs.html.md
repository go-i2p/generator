 CVS


The I2P sourcecode was kept in a CVS repository. Nowadays it is kept in
a [Monotone]() repository. For those who
aren\'t very familiar with CVS, there is a [fantastic
book](http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/cvsbook.html) on the subject
(developers only need to deal with the first chapter - \"An Overview of
CVS\", as subsequent chapters go into some nasty details very few ever
need to touch).

## Unix CVS

diffs)](http://dev.i2p.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/i2p/?f=H)

## CVS history

Commits are sent to the [CVS

Humorous quote from WinCVS: \"Did you know\... Never experiment with new
CVS commands on your working repository. Create a sample module
instead.\"

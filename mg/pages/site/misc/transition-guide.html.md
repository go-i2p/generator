 Monotone 

The I2P sourcecode is kept in several distributed monotone repositories.
See the [Monotone website](http://www.monotone.ca/) for information on
monotone. See [this forum post on i2p
monotone](http:///viewtopic.php?t=2524) for more
information on how to get started and check out the source anonymously.
There is also a quick-start guide on the [new developer\'s
page]().

If you want to get the source non-anonymously, pull from the public
server mtn.welterde.de. The i2p source code branch is \"i2p.i2p\".

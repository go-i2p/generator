"The I2P network is almost completely decentralized, with exception to "

"out of running at least one permanent bootstrap node that non-network "
"users can find to get started. Once you're connected to the network, you "
"only discover peers by building \"exploratory\" tunnels, but to make your"
" initial connection, you need to get a peer set from somewhere. The "
"reseed servers, which you can see listed on "
"http://127.0.0.1:7657/configreseed in the Java I2P router, provide you "
"with those peers. You then connect to them with the I2P router until you "

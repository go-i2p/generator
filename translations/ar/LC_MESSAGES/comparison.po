"largely to Freenet's heuristic driven routing.  The interactions of "

"certainly may successfully deter various attacks, and perhaps some "
"aspects of the \n"
"routing algorithms will provide the hoped for scalability.  "
"Unfortunately, not much\n"
"analysis of the algorithms involved has resulted in positive results, but"

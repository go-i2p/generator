## About Reseed Hosts {#about}

Reseed hosts are needed for new routers to integrate with the I2P
network. During the bootstrapping process, reseed hosts provide an
initial set of nodes for a new router to make connections with.
Occasionally an already integrated router may need to go through the
reseed process if it is experiencing connection issues with the network.
This is most often caused by its known nodes not being available.

Reseeding is done over an encrypted connection and all of the bootstrap
information is signed by the reseed host you connect to. This makes it
impossible for an unauthenticated source to provide false information.

Operating a reseed server will be familair for most sysadmins who have
experience with I2P. More reseed hosts result in more resilient I2P
network connections for new participating routers. It also makes it
harder to prevent new routers from connecting to the I2P network.

## Other Ways Of Reseeding {#other}

Other options for reseeding include file-based reseeds, where a user
with a running I2P router generates a reseed file for a friend and
transfers it to them as a .zip file. Using cloud-based infrastructure
helps to resist censorship, which aids people in situations where
reseeds may be restricted.

## Thank You Reseed Operators {#thank you}

 If you are running a reseed server, thank you for helping
to make the I2P network stronger and more resilient than ever. 

 Thank you.

 Developer
Guidelines and Coding Style 2025-03 

Read the [new developers guide]() first.

## Basic Guidelines and Coding Style

Most of the following should be common sense for anybody who has worked
on open source or in a commercial programming envrionment. The following
applies mostly to the main development branch i2p.i2p. Guidelines for
other branches, plugins, and external apps may be substantially
different; check with the appropriate developer for guidance.

### Community

- Please don\'t just \"write code\". If you can, participate in other
 development activities, including: development discussions and
 support on IRC, i2pforum.i2p; testing; bug reporting and responses;
 documentation; code reviews; etc.
- Active devs should be available periodically on IRC #i2p-dev. Be
 aware of the current release cycle. Adhere to release milestones
 such as feature freeze, tag freeze, and the checkin deadline for a
 release.

### Release Cycle

The normal release cycle is 10-16 weeks, four releases a year. Following
are the approximate deadlines within a typical 13-week cycle. Actual
deadlines for each release are set by the release manager after
consultation with the full team.

- 1-2 days after previous release: Checkins to trunk are allowed.
- 2-3 weeks after previous release: Deadline to propagate major
 changes from other branches to trunk.
- 4-5 weeks before release: Deadline to request new home page links.
- 3-4 weeks before release: Feature freeze. Deadline for major new
 features.
- 2-3 weeks before release: Hold project meeting to review new home
 page link requests, if any.
- 10-14 days before release: String freeze. No more changes to
 translated (\"tagged\") strings. Push strings to Transifex, announce
 translation deadline on Transifex.
- 10-14 days before release: Feature deadline. Bug fixes only after
 this time. No more features, refactoring or cleanup.
- 3-4 days before release: Translation deadline. Pull translations
 from Transifex and check in.
- 3-4 days before release: Checkin deadline. No checkins after this
 time without the permission of the release builder.
- Hours before release: Code review deadline.

### Git

- Have a basic understanding of distributed source control systems,
 even if you haven\'t used git before. Ask for help if you need it.
 Once pushed, checkins are forever, there is no undo. Please be
 careful. If you have not used git before, start with baby steps.
 Check in some small changes and see how it goes.
- Test your changes before checking them in. If you prefer the
 checkin-before-test development model, use your own development
 branch in your own account, and create an MR once the work is done.
 Do not break the build. Do not cause regressions. In case you do (it
 happens), please do not vanish for a long period after you push your
 change.
- If your change is non-trivial, or you want people to test it and
 need good test reports to know whether your change was tested or
 not, add a checkin comment to history.txt and increment the build
 revision in RouterVersion.java.
- Do not check in major changes into the main i2p.i2p branch late in
 the release cycle. If a project will take you more than a couple
 days, create your own branch in git, in your own account, and do the
 development there so you do not block releases.
- For big changes (generally speaking, more than 100 lines, or
 touching more than three files), check it into a new branch on your
 own gitlab account, create an MR, and assign a reviewer. Assign the
 MR to yourself. Merge the MR yourself once the reviewer approves it.
- Do not create WIP branches in the main i2p-hackers account (except
 for i2p.www). WIP belongs in your own account. When the work is
 done, create an MR. The only branches in the main account should be
 for true forks, like a point release.
- Do development in a transparent fashion and with the community in
 mind. Checkin often. Checkin or merge into the main branch as
 frequently as possible, given the guidelines above. If you are
 working on some big project in your own branch/account, let people
 know so they may follow along and review/test/comment.

### Coding Style

- Coding style throughout most of the code is 4-spaces for
 indentation. Do not use tabs. Do not reformat code. If your IDE or
 editor wants to reformat everything, get control of it. Yes, we know
 4 spaces is a pain, but perhaps you can configure your editor
 appropriately. In some places, the coding style is different. Use
 common sense. Emulate the style in the file you are modifying.
- All new public and package-private classes and methods require
 Javadocs. Add \@since release-number. Javadocs for new private
 methods are desirable.
- For any Javadocs added, there must not be any doclint errors or
 warnings. Run \'ant javadoc\' with Oracle Java 14 or higher to
 check. All params must have \@param lines, all non-void methods must
 have \@return lines, all exceptions declared thrown must have
 \@throws lines, and no HTML errors.
- Classes in core/ (i2p.jar) and portions of i2ptunnel are part of our
 official API. There are several out-of-tree plugins and other
 applications that rely on this API. Be careful not to make any
 changes that break compatibility. Don\'t add methods to the API
 unless they are of general utility. Javadocs for API methods should
 be clear and complete. If you add or change the API, also update the
 documentation on the website (i2p.www branch).
- Tag strings for translation where appropriate, which is true for all
 UI strings. Don\'t change existing tagged strings unless really
 necessary, as it will break existing translations. Do not add or
 change tagged strings after the \"tag freeze\" in the release cycle
 so that translators have a chance to update before the release.
- Use generics and concurrent classes where possible. I2P is a highly
 multi-threaded application.
- Be familiar with common Java pitfalls that are caught by findbugs.
 Run \'ant findbugs\' to learn more.
- Java 8 is required to build and run I2P as of release 0.9.47. Do not
 use Java 7 or 8 classes or methods in embedded subsystems:
 addressbook, core, i2ptunnel.jar (non-UI), mstreaming, router,
 routerconsole (news only), streaming. These subsystems are used by
 Android and embedded applications that require only Java 6. All
 classes must be available in Android API 14. Java 7 language
 features are acceptable in these subsystems if supported by the
 current version of the Android SDK and they compile to Java
 6-compatible code.
- Try-with-resources cannot be used in embedded subsystems as it
 requires java.lang.AutoCloseable in the runtime, and this is not
 available until Android API 19 (KitKat 4.4).
- The java.nio.file package cannot be used in embedded subsystems as
 it is not available until Android API 26 (Oreo 8).
- Other than the above limitations, Java 8 classes, methods, and
 constructs may be used in the following subsystems only: BOB,
 desktopgui, i2psnark, i2ptunnel.war (UI), jetty-i2p.jar, jsonrpc,
 routerconsole (except news), SAM, susidns, susimail, systray.
- Plugin authors may require any minimum Java version via the
 plugin.config file.
- Explicitly convert between primitive types and classes; don\'t rely
 on autoboxing/unboxing.
- Don\'t use URL. Use URI.
- Don\'t catch Exception. Catch RuntimeException and checked
 exceptions individually.
- Don\'t use String.getBytes() without a UTF-8 charset argument. You
 may also use DataHelper.getUTF8() or DataHelper.getASCII().
- Always specify a UTF-8 charset when reading or writing files. The
 DataHelper utilities may be helpful.
- Always specify a locale (for example Locale.US) when using
 String.toLowerCase() or String.toUpperCase(). Do not use
 String.equalsIgnoreCase(), as a locale cannot be specified.
- Don\'t use String.split(). Use DataHelper.split().
- Don\'t add code to format dates and times. Use
 DataHelper.formatDate() and formatTime().
- Ensure that InputStreams and OutputStreams are closed in finally
 blocks.
- Use {} for all for and while blocks, even if only one line. If you
 use {} for either the if, else, or if-else block, use it for all
 blocks. Put \"} else {\" on a single line.
- Specify fields as final wherever possible.
- Don\'t store I2PAppContext, RouterContext, Log, or any other
 references to router or context items in static fields.
- Don\'t start threads in constructors. Use I2PAppThread instead of
 Thread.

### Logging

The following guidelines apply to the router, webapps, and all plugins.

- For any messages not displayed at the default log level (WARN, INFO,
 and DEBUG), unless the message is a static string (no
 concatenation), always use log.shouldWarn(), log.shouldInfo(), or
 log.shouldDebug() before the log call to avoid unnecessary Object
 churn.
- Log messages that may be displayed at the default log level (ERROR,
 CRIT, and logAlways()) should be brief, clear, and understandable to
 a non-technical user. This includes exception reason text that may
 also be displayed. Consider translating if the error is likely to
 happen (for example, on form submission errors). Otherwise,
 translation is not necessary, but it may be helpful to search for
 and reuse a string that is already tagged for translation elsewhere.
- Log messages not displayed at the default log level (WARN, INFO, and
 DEBUG) are intended for developer use, and do not have the above
 requirements. However, WARN messages are available in the Android
 log tab, and may be of assistance to users debugging issues, so use
 some care with WARN messages as well.
- INFO and DEBUG log messages should be used sparingly, especially in
 hot code paths. While useful during development, consider removing
 them or commenting them out after testing is complete.
- Do not log to stdout or stderr (wrapper log).

### Licenses

- Only check in code that you wrote yourself. Before checking in any
 code or library jars from other sources, justify why it is
 necessary, verify the license is compatible, and obtain approval
 from the release manager.
- If you do obtain approval to add external code or jars, and binaries
 are available in any Debian or Ubuntu package, you must implement
 build and packaging options to use the external package instead.
 Checklist of files to modify: build.properties, build.xml,
 debian/control, debian/i2p-router.install, debian/i2p-router.links,
 debian/rules, sub-build.xml
- For any images checked in from external sources, it is your
 responsibility to first verify the license is compatible. Include
 the license and source information in the checkin comment.

### Bugs

- Managing issues are everybody\'s job, please help. Monitor for issues you can help with. Comment on, fix, and close issues
 if you can.
- New developers should start by fixing issues. When you have a fix,
 attach your patch to the issue and add the keyword
 \'review-needed\'. Do not close the issue until it\'s been
 successfully reviewed and you\'ve checked your changes in. Once
 you\'ve done this smoothly for a couple of tickets, you may follow
 the normal procedure below.
- Close an issue when you think you\'ve fixed it. We don\'t have a
 test department to verify and close tickets. If you arent sure you
 fixed it, close it and add a note saying \"I think I fixed it,
 please test and reopen if it\'s still broken\". Add a comment with
 the dev build number or revision and set the milestone to the next
 release.

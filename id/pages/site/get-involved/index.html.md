 Get Involved 

## Contribute to the I2P Network

- **Support I2P Core Development**The project hosts meetings on the
 first Tuesday of every month that are open to the community. This is
 a great opportunity to see what is happening with I2P core
 development and familiarize yourself with Roadmap tasks.
- **[Translation and Documentation]()** ---
 Help translate the website and the software into your language.
 Translators are a very important part of this decentralized project
 and your work is always appreciated. The project also welcomes
 support to help keep its documentation updated. See the [new
 translator\'s guide]() for details.

### Host Services for Yourself and Others

- **[Services]()** ---
 Self-hosting almost anything, from an SSH server for yourself to an
 ActivityPub forum for everyone and anything in between, is helpful
 to the I2P network, especially if you write down instructions for
 others. Almost anything you can think of can be made to work with
 I2P.
- **[Reseeding]()** --- Getting new
 participanting routers onto the network is a very important task,
 and that task is handled by reseed servers. The more reseed servers
 the network has, the more de-centralized and redundant its
 infrastructure becomes. It\'s a big responsibility, but it\'s pretty
 easy to set up a reseed server for new routers to bootstrap from.
 Detailed instructions can be found here [reseed server
 page]().

### Develop and Test Software

- **[Applications]()**
 --- Write or port applications for I2P. There\'s some guidelines and
 a list of ideas on the [applications page]().
- [Research --- Study or test I2P code to look for vulnerabilities.
 Both anonymity vulnerabilities from the
 various]() [threat
 models](), and DOS and other weaknesses
 due to security holes, benefit from ongoing research.

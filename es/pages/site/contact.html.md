## IRC

Our primary IRC network is the Irc2P network within I2P; a default
tunnel to this network is set up with new router installs. We are also
present on multiple standard networks like
[OFTC](http://www.oftc.net/oftc/OFTC), [EIN](http://www.einirc.de/) and
[Freenode](http://freenode.net/). All I2P-related channels on all these
network are linked to the main channels on Irc2P via relay bots.

I2P welcomes all kinds of people, as long as they are friendly and
helpful to each other.\
We disgrace hate, anger, racism, and bad speaking towards anyone.\
We do support LBGT, suppressed minorites and other people, wether they
need help in kind of our I2P software or not.\
We work together to build a free world without hate, racism and
violence.\
The I2P router software was created in this spirit and should be used to
help repressed people to regain their freedom of speech, while not
suppressing others.

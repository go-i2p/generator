Overview
========

This is the spec for the Garlic Farm wire protocol,
based on JRaft, its "exts" code for implementation over TCP,
and its "dmprinter" sample application [JRAFT]_.
JRaft is an implementation of the Raft protocol [RAFT]_.

We were unable to find any implementation with a documented wire protocol.
However, the JRaft implementation is simple enough that we could
inspect the code and then document its protocol.
This proposal is the result of that effort.

This will be the backend for coordination of routers publishing
entries in a Meta LeaseSet. See proposal 123.


Goals
=====

- Small code size
- Based on existing implementation
- No serialized Java objects or any Java-specific features or encoding
- Any bootstrapping is out-of-scope. At least one other server is assumed
  to be hardcoded, or configured out-of-band of this protocol.
- Support both out-of-band and in-I2P use cases.


Design
======

The Raft protocol is not a concrete protocol; it defines only a state machine.
Therefore we document the concrete protocol of JRaft and base our protocol on it.
There are no changes to the JRaft protocol other than the addition of
an authentication handshake.

Raft elects a Leader whose job is to publish a log.
The log contains Raft Configuration data and Application data.
Application data contains the status of each Server's Router and the Destination
for the Meta LS2 cluster.
The servers use a common algorithm to determine the publisher and contents
of the Meta LS2.
The publisher of the Meta LS2 is NOT necessarily the Raft Leader.



Specification
=============

The wire protocol is over SSL sockets or non-SSL I2P sockets.
I2P sockets are proxied through the HTTP Proxy.
There is no support for clearnet non-SSL sockets.

Handshake and authentication
----------------------------

Not defined by JRaft.

Goals:

- User/password authentication method
- Version identifier
- Cluster identifier
- Extensible
- Ease of proxying when used for I2P sockets
- Do not unnecessarily expose server as a Garlic Farm server
- Simple protocol so a full web server implementation is not required
- Compatible with common standards, so implementations may use
  standard libraries if desired

We will use an websocket-like handshake [WEBSOCKET]_ and
HTTP Digest authentication [RFC-2617]_.
RFC 2617 Basic authentication is NOT supported.
When proxying through the HTTP proxy, communicate with
the proxy as specified in [RFC-2616]_.

Credentials
```````````

Whether usernames and passwords are per-cluster, or
per-server, is implementation-dependent.


HTTP Request 1
``````````````

The originator will send the following.

All lines are teriminated with CRLF as required by HTTP.

.. raw:: html

  {% highlight %}

GET /GarlicFarm/CLUSTER/VERSION/websocket HTTP/1.1
  Host: (ip):(port)
  Cache-Control: no-cache
  Connection: close
  (any other headers ignored)
  (blank line)

  CLUSTER is the name of the cluster (default "farm")
  VERSION is the Garlic Farm version (currently "1")

{% endhighlight %}


HTTP Response 1
```````````````

If the path is not correct, the recipient will send a standard "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found" response,
as in [RFC-2616]_.

If the path is correct, the recipient will send a standard "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized" response,
including the WWW-Authenticate HTTP digest authentication header,
as in [RFC-2617]_.

Both parties will then close the socket.


HTTP Request 2
``````````````

The originator will send the following,
as in [RFC-2617]_ and [WEBSOCKET]_.

All lines are teriminated with CRLF as required by HTTP.

.. raw:: html

  {% highlight %}

GET /GarlicFarm/CLUSTER/VERSION/websocket HTTP/1.1
  Host: (ip):(port)
  Cache-Control: no-cache
  Connection: keep-alive, Upgrade
  Upgrade: websocket
  (Sec-Websocket-* headers if proxied)
  Authorization: (HTTP digest authorization header as in RFC 2617)
  (any other headers ignored)
  (blank line)

  CLUSTER is the name of the cluster (default "farm")
  VERSION is the Garlic Farm version (currently "1")

{% endhighlight %}


HTTP Response 2
```````````````

If the authentication is not correct, the recipient will send another standard "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized" response,
as in [RFC-2617]_.

If the authentication is correct, the recipient will send the following response,
as in [WEBSOCKET]_.

All lines are teriminated with CRLF as required by HTTP.

.. raw:: html

  {% highlight %}

HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
  Connection: Upgrade
  Upgrade: websocket
  (Sec-Websocket-* headers)
  (any other headers ignored)
  (blank line)

{% endhighlight %}

After this is received, the socket remains open.
The Raft protocol as defined below commences, on the same socket.


Caching
```````

Credentials shall be cached for at least one hour, so that
subsequent connections may jump directly to
"HTTP Request 2" above.



Message Types
-------------

There are two types of messages, requests and responses.
Requests may contain Log Entries, and are variable-sized;
responses do not contain Log Entries, and are fixed-size.

Message types 1-4 are the standard RPC messages defined by Raft.
This is the core Raft protocol.

Message types 5-15 are the extended RPC messages defined by
JRaft, to support clients, dynamic server changes, and
efficient log synchronization.

Message types 16-17 are the Log Compaction RPC messages defined
in Raft section 7.

- Indexes: See Raft. Initialized to 0, increases monotonically



Requests
--------

Requests contain a header and zero or more log entries.
Requests contain a fixed-size header and optional Log Entries of variable size.


Request Header

========================  ======


Application
~~~~~~~~~~~

Application contents are UTF-8 encoded [JSON]_.
See the Application Layer section below.

{% endhighlight %}


Notes
`````

The Destination ID is usually the actual destination for this message.
However, for AppendEntriesResponse, AddServerResponse, and RemoveServerResponse,
it is the ID of the current leader.

In the RequestVoteResponse, Is Accepted is 1 for a vote for the candidate (requestor),
and 0 for no vote.


Application Layer
=================

Each Server periodically posts Application data to the log in a ClientRequest.
Application data contains the status of each Server's Router and the Destination
for the Meta LS2 cluster.
The servers use a common algorithm to determine the publisher and contents
of the Meta LS2.
The server with the "best" recent status in the log is the Meta LS2 publisher.
The publisher of the Meta LS2 is NOT necessarily the Raft Leader.


Application Data Contents
-------------------------

Application contents are UTF-8 encoded [JSON]_,
for simplicity and extensibility.
The full specification is TBD.
The goal is to provide enough data to write an algorithm to determine the "best"
router to publish the Meta LS2, and for the publisher to have sufficient information
to weight the Destinations in the Meta LS2.
The data will contain both router and Destination statistics.

The data may optionally contain remote sensing data on the health of the
other servers, and the ability to fetch the Meta LS.
These data would not be supported in the first release.

The data may optionally contain configuration information posted
by an administrator client.
These data would not be supported in the first release.

If "name: value" is listed, that specifies the JSON map key and value.
Otherwise, specification is TBD.


Cluster data (top level):

- cluster: Cluster name
- date: Date of this data (long, ms since the epoch)
- id: Raft ID (integer)

Configuration data (config):

- Any configuration parameters

MetaLS publishing status (meta):

- destination: the metals destination, base64
- lastPublishedLS: if present, base64 encoding of the last published metals
- lastPublishedTime: in ms, or 0 if never
- publishConfig: Publisher config status off/on/auto
- publishing: metals publisher status boolean true/false

Router data (router):

- lastPublishedRI: if present, base64 encoding of the last published router info
- uptime: Uptime in ms
- Job lag
- Exploratory tunnels
- Participating tunnels
- Configured bandwidth
- Current bandwidth

Destinations (destinations):
List

Destination data:

- destination: the destination, base64
- uptime: Uptime in ms
- Configured tunnels
- Current tunnels
- Configured bandwidth
- Current bandwidth
- Configured connections
- Current connections
- Blacklist data

Remote router sensing data:

- Last RI version seen
- LS Fetch time
- Connection test data
- Closest floodfills profile data
  for time periods yesterday, today, and tomorrow

Remote destination sensing data:

- Last LS version seen
- LS Fetch time
- Connection test data
- Closest floodfills profile data
  for time periods yesterday, today, and tomorrow

Meta LS sensing data:

- Last version seen
- Fetch time
- Closest floodfills profile data
  for time periods yesterday, today, and tomorrow


Administration Interface
========================

TBD, possibly a separate proposal.
Not required for the first release.

Requirements of an admin interface:

- Support for multiple master destinations, i.e. multiple virtual clusters (farms)
- Provide comprehensive view of shared cluster state - all stats published by members, who is the current leader, etc.
- Ability to force removal of a participant or leader from the cluster
- Ability to force publish metaLS (if current node is publisher)
- Ability to exclude hashes from metaLS (if current node is publisher)
- Configuration import/export functionality for bulk deployments



Router Interface
================

TBD, possibly a separate proposal.
i2pcontrol is not required for the first release and detailed changes will be included in a separate proposal.

Requirements for Garlic Farm to router API (in-JVM java or i2pcontrol)

- getLocalRouterStatus()
- getLocalLeafHash(Hash masterHash)
- getLocalLeafStatus(Hash leaf)
- getRemoteMeasuredStatus(Hash masterOrLeaf) // probably not in MVP
- publishMetaLS(Hash masterHash, List<MetaLease> contents) // or signed MetaLeaseSet? Who signs?
- stopPublishingMetaLS(Hash masterHash)
- authentication TBD?


Justification
=============

Atomix is too large and won't allow customization for us to route
the protocol over I2P. Also, its wire format is undocumented, and depends
on Java serialization.


Notes
=====



Issues
======

- There's no way for a client to find out about and connect to an unknown leader.
  It would be a minor change for a Follower to send the Configuration as a Log Entry in the AppendEntriesResponse.



Migration
=========

No backward compatibility issues.

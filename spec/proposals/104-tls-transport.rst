Overview
========

This proposal is about implementing a TLS-based transport.


Motivation
==========

It's a frequently-suggested-suggestion that we have a snoop-resistant transport
so that we are resistant to fingerprinting and blocking by ISPs and state-level
adversaries, like what Tor has (i.e. tries to look like a Firefox HTTPS
session).


Design
======

TBD

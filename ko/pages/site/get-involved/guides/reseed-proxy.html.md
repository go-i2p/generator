 How to Set up a
Reseed Server using a Reverse Proxy 2023-01 

## General Information

These guidelines are based on idk\'s
[reseed-tools](https://i2pgit.org/idk/reseed-tools) server. They should
be very similar to the guidelines for DivaExchange\'s
[i2p-reseed](https://codeberg.org/diva.exchange/i2p-reseed) server.

These guidelines will help you to configure your reseed server behind a
reverse proxy like Apache2 or nginx. These will allow you to configure
additional behaviors like filtering, adding and removing headers, or
temporary logging to debug issues. The specifics of customizing your
reverse proxy are outside the scope of this document.

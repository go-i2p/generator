{% trans -%}
I2PCon has been a giant success. For us, the I2P contributors, it represents a
leap forward in terms of what we're capable of pulling off as a community, how we
communicate the usecases of I2P and reach out to privacy conscious individuals.

By arranging this event, we've also grown our community. People who've previously
only lurked on our irc channels, or run our software or possibly hadn't even heard
of I2P are now a part of our comminuty.

This event has been our first active step towards building a large and inclusive
community, and as such it's been great success.

We've had some wonderful speakers, from both inside- and outside of our community.

`David Dagon`_ talked to us about the way forward and how I2P could handle potential abuse.

`Lance James`_ - the creator of our predecessor iip - said Hi and gave us his thoughts about how far I2P has come.

`Nick Johnston`_ gave us a wonderful talk about why privacy matters and why you should care.

I would also like to thank the speakers from our community. `psi`_, `@str4d`_ and `zzz`_  who all had
wonderful talks. Improving our ability to inform people about I2P is something that
is going to be important for us going forward.

{% trans -%}
We're nearly half-way into the APIs month of Summer Dev, and making great
progress on a number of fronts. I'm happy to announce that the first of these is
complete: the I2P client libraries are now available on Maven Central!
{%- endtrans %}

{% trans -%}
This should make it much simpler for Java developers to use I2P in their
applications. Instead of needing to obtain the libraries from a current install,
they can simply add I2P to their dependencies. Upgrading to new versions will
similarly be much easier.

How to use them
===============
{%- endtrans %}

{% trans -%}
There are two libraries that you need to know about:
{%- endtrans %}

- ``net.i2p:i2p`` - {% trans %}The core I2P APIs; you can use these to send individual datagrams.{% endtrans %}
- ``net.i2p.client:streaming`` - {% trans %}A TCP-like set of sockets for communicating over I2P.{% endtrans %}

{% trans -%}
Add one or both of these to your project's dependencies, and you're good to go!
{%- endtrans %}

Gradle
------

::

    compile 'net.i2p:i2p:0.9.26'
    compile 'net.i2p.client:streaming:0.9.26'

Maven
-----

::

    <dependency>
        <groupId>net.i2p</groupId>
        <artifactId>i2p</artifactId>
        <version>0.9.26</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>net.i2p.client</groupId>
        <artifactId>streaming</artifactId>
        <version>0.9.26</version>
    </dependency>

{% trans -%}
For other build systems, see the Maven Central pages for the `core`__ and
`streaming`__ libraries.
{%- endtrans %}

{% trans -%}
Android developers should use the `I2P Android client library`__, which contains
the same libraries along with Android-specific helpers. I'll be updating it soon
to depend on the new I2P libraries, so that cross-platform applications can work
natively with either I2P Android or desktop I2P.

See our `application development`__ guide for help getting started with these
libraries. You can also chat with us about them in #i2p-dev on IRC. And if you
do start using them, let us know what you're working on with the hashtag
`#I2PSummer`__ on Twitter!

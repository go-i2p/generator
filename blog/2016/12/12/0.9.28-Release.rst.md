{% trans -%} 0.9.28 contains fixes for over 25 Trac tickets, and updates
for a number of bundled software packages including Jetty. There are
fixes for the IPv6 peer testing feature introduced last release. We
continue improvements to detect and block peers that are potentially
malicious. There are preliminary fixes for Java 9, although we do not
yet recommend Java 9 for general use. {%- endtrans %}

{% trans -%} I2P will be at 33C3, please stop by our table and give us
your ideas on how to improve the network. We will review our 2017

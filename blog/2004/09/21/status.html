Hi gang, quick update this week

* Index
1) Dev status
2) New userhosts.txt vs. hosts.txt
3) ???

* 1) Dev status

The network has been fairly stable over the last week, so
I've been able to focus my time on the 0.4.1 release -
revamping the TCP transport and adding support for detecting
IP addresses and removing that old &quot;target changed identities&quot;
thing.  This should also get rid of the need for dyndns
entries as well.

It won't be the ideal 0-click setup for people behind NATs
or firewalls - they'll still need to do the port forwarding
so they can receive inbound TCP connections.  It should
however be less error prone.  I'm doing my best to keep it
backwards compatible, but I'm not making any promises on that
front.  More news when its ready.

* 2) New userhosts.txt vs. hosts.txt

In the next release we'll have the oft-requested support for
a pair of hosts.txt files - one that is overwritten during
upgrades (or from <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dev.i2p.net/i2p/hosts.txt">http://dev.i2p.net/i2p/hosts.txt</a>) and one
that the user can maintain locally.  In the next release (or
CVS HEAD) you can edit the file &quot;userhosts.txt&quot; which is
checked before hosts.txt for any entries - please make your
local changes there, since the update process will overwrite
hosts.txt (but not userhosts.txt).

* 3) ???

As I mentioned, only a brief set of notes this week.  Anyone
have anything else they want to bring up?  Swing on by the
meeting in a few minutes.

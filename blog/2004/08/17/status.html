* 1) Network status and 0.3.4.3

While the network has been functional over the last week, there has
been a lot of trouble at times, leading to a dramatic decrease in
reliability.  The 0.3.4.2 release has helped out significantly in
addressing a DoS caused by some incompatability and time
synchronization issues - see the graph of network database
requests [1] showing the DoS (spikes off the chart) which was
stopped by the introduction of 0.3.4.2.  Unfortunately, that in
turn introduced its own set of issues, causing a significant number
of messages to be retransmitted, as can be seen in the bandwidth
plot [2].  The increased load there was also due to an actual
increase in user activity, so its not /that/ crazy ;)  But still,
it was a problem.

Over the last few days, I've been pretty selfish.  We've had a bunch
of bugfixes tested and deployed on a few routers, but I haven't
released it yet, since I rarely get to test out the interplay of
incompatabilities in the software when I run my sims.  So, you've
been subjected to exceedingly shitty network operation while I
tweak things to find ways to let routers perform well when a lot
of routers suck.  We're making progress on that front - profiling
and avoiding peers who exploit the network database, managing
network database request queues more efficiently, and enforcing
tunnel diversification.

We're not there yet, but I'm hopeful.  Tests are being run now on the
live net, and when its ready, there will be a 0.3.4.3 release pushing
the results.

Aum has been doing some kickass work on his DHT [3], and while it
currently has some significant limitations, it looks promising.  Its
definitely not ready for general use yet, but if you're up for
helping him out with testing (or coding :), check out the site and
start up a node.

Thats 'bout it for now.  Since the meeting should have started a
minute ago, I should probably wrap this up.  See y'all in #i2p!

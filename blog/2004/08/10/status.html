Hey everyone, weekly update time

* Index:
1) 0.3.4.1 status
2) Updated docs
3) 0.4 progress
4) ???

* 1) 0.3.4.1 status

Well, we've pushed out the 0.3.4.1 release the other day, and it has
been doing pretty well.  Connect times on irc have been consistently
for multiple hours, and transfer rates are doing pretty good as well
(I pulled 25KBps from one eepsite(I2P Site) the other day using 3 parallel
streams).

One really cool feature added in with the 0.3.4.1 release (that I
forgot to add to the release announcement) was mule's patch to allow
the eepproxy to round robin non-i2p requests through a series of
outproxies.  The default is still just to use the squid.i2p outproxy,
but if you go into your router.config and change the clientApp line
to have:
  -e 'httpclient 4444 squid.i2p,www1.squid.i2p'
it will randomly route each HTTP request through one of the two
outproxies listed (squid.i2p and www1.squid.i2p).  With that, if
there are a few more people running outproxies, y'all won't be so
dependent upon the squid.i2p.  Of course, you've all heard my
concerns regarding outproxies, but having this capability gives
people more options.

We have been seeing some instability over the last few hours, but
with the help of duck and cervantes, I've identified two nasty bugs
and am testing out fixes atm.  The fixes are significant, so I do
expect to have a 0.3.4.2 out in the next day or two, after I've
verified the results.

* 2) Updated docs

We've been slacking a bit on getting the documentation on the site
up to date, and while there are still a few big holes (e.g. the
netDb [1] and i2ptunnel [2] docs), we've recently updated a few of
them (network comparisons [3] and the faq [4]).  As we are moving
closer to the 0.4 and 1.0 releases, I would appreciate if people
could go through the site and see what can be improved upon.

Of particular note is an updated Hall of Fame [5] - we've finally
got that sync'ed up to reflect the generous donations y'all have
made (thanks!)  As we move forward, we will be using these
resources to compensate coders and other contributors, as well as
to offset any costs incurred (e.g. hosting providers, etc).

* 3) 0.4 progress

Looking back at last week's notes [6], we've still got a few things
left for 0.4, but the simulations have been going quite well, and
the majority of the kaffe problems have been found.  What would be
great though is if people could hammer away at different aspects of
the router or the client apps and file any bugs [7] you come across.

* 4) ???

Thats all I've got to bring up at the moment - I appreciate the time
y'all are taking to help move us forward, and I think we're making
great progress.  Of course, if anyone has anything else they want
to talk about, swing on by the meeting in #i2p at... er... now :)

Hi gang, time for our weekly update

* Index:
1) 0.4.1.2
2) 0.4.1.3
3) 0.4.2
4) mail discussions
5) ???

* 1) 0.4.1.2

The new 0.4.1.2 release has been out for a few days and things have
been going pretty much as expected - there have been a few bumps with
the new watchdog component though, causing it to kill your router
when things are Bad rather than to restart it.  As I mentioned
earlier today [1], I'm looking for people to use the new stats
logging tool to send me some data, so your help there would be
greatly appreciated.

* 2) 0.4.1.3

There will be another release before 0.4.2 is out, as I want the
network to be as solid as possible before moving on.  What I'm
experimenting with at the moment is a dynamic throttle on the tunnel
pariticpation - telling routers to probabalistically reject requests
if they're flooded or their tunnels are slower than usual.  These
probabilities and thresholds are calculated dynamically from the
stats being kept - if your 10 minute tunnel test time is greater than
your 60 minute tunnel test time, accept the tunnel request with a
probability of 60minRate/10minRate (and if your current # of tunnels
is greater than your 60 minute average number of tunnels, accept it
w/ p=60mRate/curTunnels).

Another potential throttle is to smooth the bandwidth along those
lines - rejecting tunnels probabalistically when our bandwidth usage
spikes.  Anyway, the intent of all of this is to help spread out the
network usage and balance the tunnels across more people.  The main
problem we've had with the load balancing has been an overwhelming
*excess* of capacity, and as such none of our &quot;damn we're slow, lets
reject&quot; triggers have been hit.  These new probabalistic ones should
hopefully keep rapid change in check.

I don't have any specific plan for when the 0.4.1.3 release will be
out - maybe the weekend.  The data people send in (from above) should
help determine whether this will be worthwhile, or if there are other
avenues more worthwhile.

* 3) 0.4.2

As we discussed in last week's meeting, we've switched around the
0.4.2 and 0.4.3 releases - 0.4.2 will be the new streaming lib, and
0.4.3 will be the tunnel update.

I've been rereviewing the literature for TCP's streaming
functionality and there are some interesting topics of concern for
I2P.  Specifically, our high round trip time  leans towards something
like XCP [2], and we should probably be quite aggressive with various
forms of explicit congestion notification, though we can't take
advantage of something like the timestamp option, since our clocks
can be skewed by up to a minute.

In addition, we'll want to make sure we can optimize the streaming
lib to handle short lived connections (which vanilla TCP pretty much
sucks at) - for instance, I want to be able to be able to send small
(&lt;32KB) HTTP GET requests and small (&lt;32KB) replies in literally
three messages:
    Alice--&gt;Bob: syn+data+close
    Bob--&gt;Alice: ack+data+close (the browser gets the response now)
    Alice--&gt;Bob: ack (so he doesn't resend the payload)

Anyway, not much code has been cut on this yet, with the protocol
side of things looking pretty much TCP-like and the packets somewhat
like a merging of human's proposal [3] and the old proposal [4].  If
anyone has any suggestions or ideas, or wants to help out with the
implementation, please get in touch.

* 4) mail discussion

There have been some interesting discussions regarding email in (and
out of) I2P - postman has put a set of ideas online [5] and is
looking for suggestions.  There have also been related discussions on
the #mail.i2p.  Perhaps we can get postman to give us an update?

* 5) ???

Thats about it for the moment.  Swing on by the meeting in a few
minutes and bring your comments :)

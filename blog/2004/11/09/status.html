Hey everyone, weekly update time

* Index:
1) 0.4.1.4
2) Streaming lib
3) BT progress
4) addressbook.py
5) ???

* 1) 0.4.1.4

The other day we pushed out a new patch update, and 2/3rds of the
network has upgraded so far - thanks!  Reports have been positive,
including lower CPU usage and less failures, along side lower memory
usage.  The network as a whole has grown a bit, staying consistently
in the upper 70s/low 80s as well, which is a good healthy number for
the time being.

* 2) Streaming lib

Lets see if I can say the same thing three weeks in a row... Lots of
progress, more details when they're available :)

* 3) BT progress

The BitTorrent port has been making leaps and bounds as of late - the
other day I installed it and was able to do a swarming transfer
between multiple peers entirely through I2P!  Perhaps duck can give
us an update during the meeting?

* 4) addressbook.py

Ragnarok has put together a python app which lets you subscribe to
other people's hosts files, importing and merging new entries with
your own.  This gives us a base implementation of an addressbook
based naming system with locally unique, human readable, and secure
names!  Perhaps we can get Ragnarok to fill us in on further details
in the meeting?

* 5) ???

Thazzit... sorry for the delay, woke up 5 minutes ago :)  see y'all
shortly

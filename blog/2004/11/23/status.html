Hi y'all, time for a status update

* Index:

1) Net status
2) Streaming lib
3) 0.4.2
4) Addressbook.py 0.3.1
5) ???

* 1) Net status

After last week's 2-3 day stint of things being pretty congested, the
network has come back on track (likely because we stopped stress
testing the bittorrent port ;).  The network has been pretty reliable
since then - we do have a few routers that have been up and running
for 30-40+ days, but IRC connections have still had their occational
bumps.  On the other hand...

* 2) Streaming lib

For the last week or so, we've been doing a lot more live testing of
the streaming lib on the network and things have been looking pretty
good.  Duck set up a tunnel with it that people could use to access
his IRC server, and over the course of a few days, I only had two
unnecessary disconnects (which helped us track down some bugs).
We've also had an i2ptunnel instance pointing at a squid outproxy
that people have been trying out, and both the throughput, latency,
and reliability are much improved when compared to the old lib, which
we did side by side.

All in all, the streaming lib looks to be in good enough shape for a
first release.  There are a few things left not yet completed, but
its a significant improvement on the old lib, and we've got to give
you a reason to upgrade later, right?  ;)

Actually, just to tease you (or perhaps inspire you to come up with
some solutions), the main things I see coming down the line for the
streaming lib are:
 = some algorithms to share congestion and RTT information across
   streams (per target destination?  per source destination?  for
   all of the local destinations?)
 = further optimizations for interactive streams (most of the focus
   in the current implementation is on bulk streams)
 = more explicit use of the new streaming lib's features in
   I2PTunnel, reducing the per-tunnel overhead.
 = client level bandwidth limiting (in either or both directions
   on a stream, or possibly shared across multiple streams).  This
   would be in addition to the router's overall bandwidth limiting,
   of course.
 = various controls for destinations to throttle how many streams
   they accept or create (we have some basic code, but largely
   disabled)
 = access control lists (only allowing streams to or from certain
   other known destinations)
 = web controls and monitoring the health of the various streams,
   as well as the ability to explicitly close or throttle them

Y'all can probably come up with some other things too, but thats
just a brief list of things I'd love to see in the streaming lib,
but won't hold up the 0.4.2 release for.  If anyone is interested
in any of those, please, lemmie know!

* 3) 0.4.2

So, if the streaming lib is in good shape, when are we gong to have
the release?  The current plan is to push it out the door by the
end of the week, maybe even as soon as tomorrow.  There are a few
other things going on that I want to get sorted first, and of
course those need to be tested, yadda yadda yadda.

The big change in the 0.4.2 release will of course be the new
streaming lib.  From an API perspective, it is identical to the
old lib - I2PTunnel and SAM streams automatically use it, but from
a packet perspective, it is *not* backwards compatible.  This leaves
us with an interesting dilemma - there is nothing within I2P
requiring us to make 0.4.2 into a manditory upgrade, however people
who don't upgrade won't be able to use I2PTunnel - no eepsites(I2P Sites), no
IRC, no outproxy, no email.  I don't want to alienate our long time
users by forcing them to upgrade, but I also don't want to alienate
them by having everything useful break ;)

I'm open to being convinced either way - it would be easy enough to
change a single line of code so that the 0.4.2 release won't talk to
the older releases, or we could just let it be and have people
upgrade whenever they go to the website or forum to bitch about
everything being broken.  What do y'all think?

* 4) Addressbook.py 0.3.1

Ragnarok has come out with a new patch release for his address book
app - see <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://ragnarok.i2p/">http://ragnarok.i2p/</a> for more info (or perhaps he can give
us an update in the meeting?)

* 5) ???

I know there's a lot more activity going on - with the bittorrent
port, susimail, slacker's new hosting service, among other things.
Anyone have anything else to bring up?  If so, swing on by the
meeting in ~30m in #i2p on the usual IRC servers!

# 0.8.8 Release {.title}

I2P release 0.8.8 enables the new hosts.txt database to speed hostname
lookups and store additional information on hostname entries. It also
includes improvements to speed a router\'s integration on startup. There
is new code to detect and react to large clock shifts that should help a
router recover after suspend/resume of the computer.

There are new translations for Danish and Ukranian and lots of updates
in other languages. Also included are, of course, a large collection of
bug fixes, performance improvements, and updates to deal with the
continued rapid expansion of the network.

Please help grow the network. [Get
involved](http://www.i2p2.de/getinvolved.html), spread the word, and
[donate](http://www.i2p2.de/donate.html)! If you find a bug, please
enter a report on
[gitlab](http://i2pgit.org/i2p-hackers/i2p.i2p/issues). We are still
looking for help on new and existing translations. Please volunteer on
IRC #i2p-dev.

**Release Details**

**Major changes**

\* Enable new hosts.txt database for 10x faster lookups and ability to
store additional information about entries. The database is created on
upgrade, and populated with entries from the hosts.txt,
privatehosts.txt, userhosts.txt files. Do not edit your \*hosts.txt
files manually after the upgrade; you must use the addressbook interface
in the router console to add or delete entries.\
\* (New installs only) Wrapper and jbigi support for ARM v5 processors.
The support added in 0.8.7 only worked for ARM v7 processors. We now
support both.\
\* (New installs only) Wrapper and jbigi support for 64 bit x86 and PPC
processors for OSX, and PPC for Linux. The support added in 0.8.7 only
worked for 32-bit processors on OSX. We now support both.

**Bug Fixes**

\* Fix some Null Pointer Exceptions in the console at startup\
\* Fix some problems with wrapper interaction at shutdown\
\* Fix several issues with \"soft\" restart, used when the network
configuration changes, or when IP changes in \"laptop mode\"\
\* Fix problems with tunnel tests after the tunnel pool is shut down\
\* Rename the private key file for a tunnel after deleting the tunnel,
so it isn\'t inadvertently reused when a new tunnel is created\
\* Fix several hosts database file bugs, and add improved corruption
detection and recovery\
\* Fix cases where thread dump wouldn\'t work\
\* Speed up network integration for new routers and routers that had
been stopped for a long time\
\* Fix a bug which would leave UPnP ports open after shutdown\
\* Fix UPnP errors when running on computers with multiple network
interfaces\
\* Fix some of the character encoding issues in susimail (still has some
problems)\
\* Change several log errors to warnings

**Other**

\* Lots of improvements in the router shutdown code\
\* Improvements in recognizing and reacting to large clock shifts
(generally caused by system suspend / resume). There are still issues
remaining. Large clock shifts now cause a \"soft\" restart.\
\* Increase the number of floodfills again\
\* Increase the number of fast peers for those with several local
destinations\
\* Increase the default news fetch time, which will extend the network
upgrade period\
\* Add the router version to the update file zip signature to prevent
version spoofing\
\* Support readonly hosts database files\
\* Remove floodfills from the exploration search message, which will
help exploration work much better.\
\* Increase the netdb exploration speed when starting up, to help new
routers integrate more quickly\
\* Speed up the enumeration of floodfill routers\
\* Several other performance improvements\
\* New Danish and Ukrainian translations\
\* Translation updates for Chinese, Italian, Polish, Russian, Spanish
and Swedish

# 0.8.3 Release {.title}

The 0.8.3 release contains several performance improvements, including
reduction of threads and memory usage, and faster I2CP (client-router)
communication.

There is also new SSL router console support, a new reseed configuration
page including HTTP proxy support for those behind restrictive
firewalls, a new I2CP configuration section including I2CP-over-SSL
support for remote clients, a new server connection limits and blacklist
configuration section for enhanced DoS protection, and a new HTTP proxy
jump server configuration section so you may easily add alternative jump
servers. Statistics are now limited by default to reduce memory usage;
the full set of statistics may be re-enabled on the stats configuration
page. There are also bug fixes, of course, so as usual, upgrading is
recommended.

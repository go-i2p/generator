# 0.8.7 Release {.title}

I2P release 0.8.7 contains several upgrades to long-neglected
components, including the Naming Services, graphing, the native CPU ID
and BigInteger libraries, crypto implementations, and the wrapper.

Thanks to new contributor KillYourTV who was instrumental in
implementing and testing these upgrades, with additional support from
sponge and hottuna.

CPU ID enhancements are by hottuna, generously funded by
<http://relakks.com/> and <http://ipredator.se/> - thanks to Peter Sunde
and Jan-Erik Fiske for their support.

Also, for the first time, we now have an official [I2P Personal Package
Archive (PPA) on
launchpad.net](https://launchpad.net/~i2p-maintainers/+archive/i2p). For
those of you using Ubuntu, this offers an easy way to install I2P and
keep the various components up-to-date. The I2P package offers the
option of installing as a service, or it may be started on-demand as
usual. This PPA is currently maintained by KillYourTV with support by
other members of the development team. The [Ubuntu/Debian installation
instructions](http://www.i2p2.de/debian) are on our website.

For those updating over the network, this update is about 4 times the
usual size, due to the inclusion of the jbigi updates. Please be patient
while downloading the update over the network.

Please help grow the network. [Get
involved](http://www.i2p2.de/getinvolved.html), spread the word, and
[donate](http://www.i2p2.de/donate.html)! If you find a bug, please
enter a report on
[gitlab](http://i2pgit.org/i2p-hackers/i2p.i2p/issues). We are still
looking for help on new and existing translations. Please volunteer on
IRC #i2p-dev.

**Big changes (upgrades and new installs)**

\* NamingService upgrades to support new features, including a hosts.txt
database that will be enabled in release 0.8.8\
\* New form in the HTTP proxy to save new hosts with address helpers to
hosts.txt\
\* Speedups for SHA-256 and SHA-1 hash computation, most noticeable on
GNU JVMs.\
\* Upgrade to JRobin 1.5.9 for better-looking performance graphs\
\* Persistent graph data across restarts

\* JCpuid / JBigI upgraded to libgmp 4.3.2 / 5.0.2 and the libraries are
PIC compliant, and contain improved support 64-bit on most
architectures. JBigI is a native library which significantly speeds up
cryptography operations.

\- For those on grsec / ASLR kernels where I2P was crashing due to
non-PIC libraries, I2P should now work.\
- For those on x86 64-bit systems, crypto will be faster (typical result
is a 25% improvement), which you may notice in lower CPU usage\
- For those on ARM or x86 OS X systems, crypto should be much faster, as
we did not have jbigi support for these systems before.\
- For those on most other 32-bit Linux, FreeBSD, or Windows systems,
there should be no noticeable change in performance.

**Big changes (new installs only)**

\* The Wrapper was updated to version 3.5.9 and the libraries are now
PIC compliant, and support 64-bit on most architectures. For those who
did not have a working wrapper before (those on grsec / ASLR kernels, or
freebsd, ARM ,or x86 OS X) manual upgrade of your wrapper libraries is
possible. Instructions at <http://www.i2p2.de/manualwrapper> . For
FreeBSD users see <http://www.i2p2.de/faq#compat6x> . Alternative:
delete existing installation and install a new. Second alternative for
Ubuntu: delete existing install and use PPA. For those who have a
working wrapper now, a manual upgrade is NOT recommended.

**Packaging news:**

\* Debian / Ubuntu - Major upgrade of the Debian packaging scripts to
comply with packaging rules.\
\* PPA - As described above.

**Bug Fixes**

\* The update includes local Jetty patches that were inadvertently
omitted from the 0.8.3 and 0.8.5 install packages,\
\* A workaround for noncompliant UPnP devices\
\* Fix bug preventing Robert from initiating a connection to i2psnark

**Other**

\* More adjustments for recent network growth, including increasing the
number of floodfills and lowering the number of router infos stored
locally.\
\* Exchange version numbers across I2CP, to allow future changes to be
backward-compatible\
\* Swedish translation, thanks 123hund123, hottuna and digitalmannen\
\* Partial Finnish, Italian, Polish, and Vietnamese translations, thanks
to the Transifex translation teams\
\* Arabic translation updates, thanks hamada\
\* Russian translation updates, thanks hiddenz\
\* GeoIP update (new installs only)

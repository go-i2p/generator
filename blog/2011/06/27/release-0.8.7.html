<p>I2P release 0.8.7 contains several upgrades to long-neglected components,
 including the Naming Services, graphing, the native CPU ID and BigInteger
 libraries, crypto implementations, and the wrapper.</p>

<p>Thanks to new contributor KillYourTV who was instrumental in implementing
 and testing these upgrades, with additional support from sponge and hottuna.</p>

<p>CPU ID enhancements are by hottuna, generously funded by
 <a href="http://relakks.com/">http://relakks.com/</a> and <a href="http://ipredator.se/">http://ipredator.se/</a> -
 thanks to Peter Sunde and Jan-Erik Fiske for their support.</p>

<p>Also, for the first time, we now have an official
<a href="https://launchpad.net/~i2p-maintainers/+archive/i2p">I2P Personal Package Archive (PPA) on launchpad.net</a>.
For those of you using Ubuntu, this offers an easy way to install I2P and keep the
 various components up-to-date. The I2P package offers the option of installing as
 a service, or it may be started on-demand as usual. This PPA is currently maintained
 by KillYourTV with support by other members of the development team.
The <a href="http://www.i2p2.de/debian">Ubuntu/Debian installation instructions</a> are on our website.
</p>

<p>For those updating over the network, this update is about 4 times the usual size,
 due to the inclusion of the jbigi updates. Please be patient while downloading the update over the network.

<p><strong>Big changes (upgrades and new installs)</strong></p>

<p>* NamingService upgrades to support new features, including a hosts.txt database that will be enabled in release 0.8.8
<br />* New form in the HTTP proxy to save new hosts with address helpers to hosts.txt
<br />* Speedups for SHA-256 and SHA-1 hash computation, most noticeable on GNU JVMs.
<br />* Upgrade to JRobin 1.5.9 for better-looking performance graphs
<br />* Persistent graph data across restarts</p>

<p>* JCpuid / JBigI upgraded to libgmp 4.3.2 / 5.0.2 and the libraries are PIC compliant, and contain improved
 support 64-bit on most architectures. JBigI is a native library which significantly speeds up cryptography operations.</p>

<p>  - For those on grsec / ASLR kernels where I2P was crashing due to non-PIC libraries, I2P should now work.
<br />  - For those on x86 64-bit systems, crypto will be faster (typical result is a 25% improvement),
 which you may notice in lower CPU usage
<br />   - For those on ARM or x86 OS X systems, crypto should be much faster, as we did not have jbigi
 support for these systems before.
<br />   - For those on most other 32-bit Linux, FreeBSD, or Windows systems, there should be no
 noticeable change in performance.</p>

<p><strong>Big changes (new installs only)</strong></p>

<p>* The Wrapper was updated to version 3.5.9 and the libraries are now PIC compliant, and support 64-bit on
 most architectures. For those who did not have a working wrapper before (those on grsec / ASLR kernels, or
 freebsd, ARM ,or x86 OS X) manual upgrade of your wrapper libraries is possible. Instructions at
 <a href="http://www.i2p2.de/manualwrapper">http://www.i2p2.de/manualwrapper</a> . For FreeBSD users see
 <a href="http://www.i2p2.de/faq#compat6x">http://www.i2p2.de/faq#compat6x</a> . Alternative: delete
 existing installation and install a new. Second alternative for Ubuntu: delete existing install and
 use PPA. For those who have a working wrapper now, a manual upgrade is NOT recommended.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging news:</strong></p>

<p>* Debian / Ubuntu - Major upgrade of the Debian packaging scripts to comply with packaging rules.
<br />* PPA - As described above.</p>

<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>

<p>* The update includes local Jetty patches that were inadvertently omitted from the 0.8.3 and 0.8.5 install packages,
<br />* A workaround for noncompliant UPnP devices
<br />* Fix bug preventing Robert from initiating a connection to i2psnark</p>

<p><strong>Other</strong></p>

<p>* More adjustments for recent network growth, including increasing the number of floodfills and lowering the number of router infos stored locally.
<br />* Exchange version numbers across I2CP, to allow future changes to be backward-compatible
<br />* Swedish translation, thanks 123hund123, hottuna and digitalmannen
<br />* Partial Finnish, Italian, Polish, and Vietnamese translations, thanks to the Transifex translation teams
<br />* Arabic translation updates, thanks hamada
<br />* Russian translation updates, thanks hiddenz
<br />* GeoIP update (new installs only)</p>

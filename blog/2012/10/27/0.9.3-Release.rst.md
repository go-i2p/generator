# 0.9.3 Release {.title}

{% trans -%} 0.9.3 includes extensive low-level changes to the queueing
of messages in the router. We implement the CoDel Active Queue
Management (AQM) algorithm. We also unify the queueing and priority
mechanisms in the transports to aid diagnosis and reduce network
latency. Work continues on fixing UDP transport bugs and making UDP more
resistant to attacks. There are more changes to improve the performance
of the router and reduce its memory usage. Also, we enable i2psnark\'s
DHT support, introduced last release, by default. {%- endtrans %} {%
trans -%} As usual, there\'s also lots of bug fixes in this release, so
updating is recommended. {%- endtrans %}

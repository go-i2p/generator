# 0.9.2 Release {.title}

{% trans -%} 0.9.2 includes extensive low-level changes to improve the
performance and efficiency of the router. We have updated our UPnP
library, to hopefully make UPnP work for more people. I2PSnark now has
DHT support, but it is not yet enabled by default, as we plan to do more
testing during the upcoming 0.9.3 development cycle. {%- endtrans %} {%
trans -%} As usual, there\'s also lots of bug fixes in this release, so
updating is recommended. {%- endtrans %}

page](%7B%7Bget_url('downloads_list')%7D%7D){.reference .external}. {%-

**RELEASE DETAILS**

**Major Changes**

-   SSU: Fix several problems in our UDP transport, to improve
    efficiency and reliability for connection setup. Also improve
    defenses against various types of bad input.
-   UPnP: Updated our library to fix several issues, should work for
    more routers now
-   Transport: Improve performance in both our TCP and UDP transports,
    to benefit high-bandwidth routers
-   Crypto: The thresholds and number of ElGamal/AES Session Tags
    delivered are now much more flexible, which should lessen protocol
    overhead and reduce stalls caused by dropped tags.
-   I2PSnark: Add DHT support, not yet enabled by default, will do
    further testing and plan to enable by default in 0.9.3.

# 0.9.4 Release {.title}

{% trans -%} 0.9.4 includes a fix for a network capacity bug, introduced
in 0.9.2, that was reducing network performance and reliability. It also
includes major changes in the in-network update system, and adds the
capability to update via in-network torrents. {%- endtrans %}

{% trans -%} We fixed several bugs in the i2psnark DHT implementation
that was introduced last release. For those of you using console or http
proxy passwords, we converted to the more-secure digest method and
improved the security for console forms. {%- endtrans %}

{% trans -%} For those of you already running development builds, your
router should automatically update to 0.9.4-0 using the new in-network
torrent facility. For those running 0.9.3-0, you will update normally
using in-network HTTP, and we will have more information for you when we
release 0.9.5. {%- endtrans %}

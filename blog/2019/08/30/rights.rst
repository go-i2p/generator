================================================

The messages from activists in Syria during the Access No\_! session on the
first day were deeply moving and really drove home why I work in digital
rights. We listened to the experiences of activists who are unable to travel
due to lack of status, documentation and active conflict. For these people
“the internet is the only passport (they) carry.” Human rights defenders
spoke of the importance of  digital training to keep people protected when they
are communicating with family inside of the country, as well as with family and
friends who have left. They had created digital clinics to show people how to
use services securely, for instance, how to use features like Signal’s
disappearing messages so that those messages could not be used against them
when devices are searched at security check points. Continuing to pursue
education was also very important, the internet being relied on to access
resources.

The following days we met with people who had both questions about I2P and
suggestions for potential use cases. We also discussed overhauling the project
documentation for threat models, improving guides for users with little
technical background, and ensuring that these guides are easily translatable. I
made a note that I should go through the proposals and connect then to human
use cases and solutions. This will be part of the projects’ continued effort
to improve its user guides and onboarding.

The opportunity to meet face to face with people who are using I2P and have
successfully used it to circumvent internet blockages was inspiring. As the
project has began working on its own browser and is examining outproxy
packaging, it needs as much feedback and testing as possible to create secure
and frictionless experiences for people. Also, the I2P network needs more
hosted content and mirrored sites in order to expand resources for its users.

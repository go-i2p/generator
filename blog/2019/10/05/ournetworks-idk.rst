===================================================

{% trans -%}
The weekend of September 20th I traveled to Toronto to meet with Sadie to take
part in the Our Networks conference. The Our Networks conference encompasses a
wide variety of topic including many peer-to-peer technologies with an eye
toward their potential to make the world a better place.

The conference was fascinating, full of very smart people working on everything
from physical mesh networks to the distributed web to, of course, anonymity. We
got to talk to some great people from Tor, Protocol Labs, Parity Labs, the Dat
Project, as well as a variety of artists and social scientists. Lots of fun too,
and a great environment. Dat in particular presents some pretty cool
opportunities for future co-operation I think.

I hadn't planned on giving a talk, but we were having so much fun that when
we were asked, Sadie and I put something together and I gave a quick lightning
talk about I2P and how it's design choices are relevant to Peer-to-Peer
application development. The talk was recorded and when the video becomes
available, I'll make sure to add it to this blog. Next year, I'll have some
submissions for their Zine Library about I2P.

Besides that, I really enjoyed my time visiting Toronto, it was a great place
to visit.

Highlighting Research - An Empirical Study of the I2P Anonymity Network and its Censorship Resistance

The following blog post is authored by Information Controls Fellow Hoàng Nguyên
Phong. As an ICFP fellow, Phong's research focused on analyzing different
aspects of the I2P network, a privacy-enhancing Internet tool that can be used
to access online content over an anonymity-enhancing network helpful in
circumventing state-imposed censorship. Working with his host organization, the
University of Massachusetts Amherst, Phong studied the I2P network's censorship
resilience, including identifying what blocking methods a state censor might use
to inhibit access to I2P and investigating potential solutions to make I2P more
resistant to such blockage.

Phong found blocking attempts on the I2P network (specifically via DNS
poisoning, SNI-based blocking, TCP packet injection, and page-specific blocks)
emanating from five countries: China, Oman, Qatar, Iran, and Kuwait. Phong
posits that because the blocks are usually imposed on the I2P download page and
reseed servers, such blocking could be mitigated by hosting download links to
this content on large cloud service providers - raising the collateral cost of
blocking. Phong also built a metrics portal for the platform so that researchers
and others can better understand who is using I2P, finding that there are about
20,000 relays in the network on a daily basis.

We thank Phong and his collaborators for their excellent study as we move to
address the issues that were identified. It's exciting to see more academic
study of I2P and are excited to keep working with him.

I2P release 0.6.2
=====================

The 0.6.2 release delivers performance and anonymity improvements.
LeaseSet data is no longer added to every end-to-end message,
reducing protocol overhead.

Unreachable peers are avoided as inbound tunnel gateways,
which helps reliability and makes it possible to use
persistent Lease selection, which in turn helps performance
by reducing out-of-order message delivery.

The sequence of peers in a tunnel is now kept in a strict order
according to XOR distance from a random value, to make it harder
for an adversary to gather statistics for a predecessor attack.
Improvements to applications like I2PSnark and the Router Console
are also introduced.

This release is backward compatible: if you already have
0.6.1.31 or greater installed, it will recognize the signature
on the signed update file, and you can update automatically.

As customary, for people who don't have the option
of checking GPG signatures, supplied below are the

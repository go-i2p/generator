I2P release 0.6.5
=====================

The 0.6.5 release introduces new components,
drops some old ones (like the old TCP transport)
and has been optimized to perform better.

The BOB (Basic Open Bridge) protocol is introduced,
for use by client applications which cannot import
I2CP libraries directly. This deprecates the old
SAM protocol which was previously used in such cases.
For now however, BOB is not started automatically yet on
new installations, and SAM remains active on old installations.

Improved code should be better at preventing congestion
by probabalistically dropping participating traffic,
and likewise behave better when congestion occurs.
The floodfill NetDB should operate more reliably,
the streaming library should choose better message sizes,
offer a socket timeout function, and work proceeds
on the "hidden" mode of operation for I2P routers.

- From this release onward, I2P requires Java 1.5 or higher.
If you are uncertain about your Java version, you can verify
by opening a terminal window or command prompt, and entering
the command "java -version". If you have an older Java installed,
please update it first!

This release is backward compatible: if you already have
0.6.1.31 or greater installed, it will recognize the signature
on the signed update file, and you can update automatically.

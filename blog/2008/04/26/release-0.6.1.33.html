I2P release 0.6.1.33
=====================

The 0.6.1.33 release contains several important bug fixes
and performance improvements in SSU reachability detection,
floodfill peer selection, tunnel peer selection, tunnel testing,
NTCP idle detection, the streaming lib, and news fetching.
It also adds secondary tracker support to i2psnark, and verification
of downloaded Jetty libraries when building from source.

Please upgrade as soon as you can, as these fixes
should improve the reliability of the whole network.
This release is backward compatible: if you already have
0.6.1.31 or greater installed, it will recognize the signature
on the signed update file, and you can update automatically.

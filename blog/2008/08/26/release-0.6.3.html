I2P release 0.6.3
=====================

The 0.6.3 release introduces multiple bugfixes, optimizations
and security improvements. Routers will start monitoring the number
of well-behaved NetDB peers, volunteering as one if a shortage develops
and they can. Well-behaved NetDB nodes are preferred stronger,
and ill-behaved nodes blacklisted more effectively.

LeaseSets are handled more efficiently, new fixes should enable
the correct operation of UDP introducers. I2P also gains
preliminary support for permanent IP blocklists, and a new
peer connection limiter. Improvements to the Router Console
should make configuring client applications easier and I2PSnark
will now resist corrupt data better.

This release is backward compatible: if you already have
0.6.1.31 or greater installed, it will recognize the signature
on the signed update file, and you can update automatically.

{% trans -%}
I2P is not affected by the log4j 0-Day vulnerability which was published
yesterday, CVE-2021-44228. I2P doesn't use log4j for logging, however we also
needed to review our dependencies for log4j usage, especially jetty. This
review has not revealed any vulnerabilities.

{% trans -%}
It was also important to check all of our plugins. Plugins may bring in their
own logging systems, including log4j. We found that most plugins also do not use
log4j, and those that do did not use a vulnerable version of log4j.

{% trans -%}
We haven't found any dependency, plugin or app that's vulnerable.
{%- endtrans %}

{% trans -%}
We bundle a log4j.properties file with jetty for plugins that introduce log4j. This
file only has an effect on plugins which use log4j logging internally. We have
checked in the recommended mitigation to the log4j.properties file. Plugins which
enable log4j will run with the vulnerable feature disabled. As we cannot find any
usage of log4j 2.x anywhere, we have no plans to do an emergency release at this 
time.

   :excerpt: {% trans %}The site i2pbrowser.net is a fake I2P website mirror serving up malware for Windows.{% endtrans %}

{% trans -%}
We have recently been made aware of the existence of i2pbrowser.net. This
website copies our homepage and download page, and attempts to trick users into
downloading Windows malware.
{%- endtrans %}

{% trans -%}
There are several indicators that point to i2pbrowser.net being a malware site:
{%- endtrans %}

- {% trans %}The domain was registered on February 10th, 2014.{% endtrans %}
- {% trans %}The download URLs for Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, Android etc. all link to the same .exe file.{% endtrans %}
- {% trans %}The .exe is only 741 KB; the official Windows installer for I2P is 13 MB.{% endtrans %}

{% trans -%}
We have not examined the malware ourselves, but it does not appear to be very
sophisticated; it is not integrated into or bundled with the I2P software.
Information security expert `Lance James`__ posted `a tweet`__ labelling it as
"a standard dark comet rat".

Spread the word. The only official download locations for I2P are linked on our
`download page`__. All I2P download packages are GPG-signed by the
`release signing key`__.

{% trans -%} Update details {%- endtrans %}
============================================

{% trans -%} This release includes bug fixes in i2psnark, the router,
I2CP, and UPnP. Router fixes address bugs in soft restart, IPv6, SSU
peer testing, network database stores, and tunnel building. Router
family handling and Sybil classification have also been significantly
improved. {%- endtrans %}

{% trans -%} Together with i2pd, we are developing our new UDP
transport, SSU2. SSU2 will bring substantial performance and security
improvements. It will also allow us to finally replace our last usage of
the very slow ElGamal encryption, completing the full cryptography
upgrade we started about 9 years ago. This release contains a
preliminary implementation which is disabled by default. If you wish to
participate in testing, please look for current information on zzz.i2p.

{% trans -%} As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The
best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest
release. {%- endtrans %}

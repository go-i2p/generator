{% trans -%} Update details {%- endtrans %}
============================================

{% trans -%} We have spent the last three months working on our new UDP
transport protocol \"SSU2\" with a small number of volunteer testers.
This release completes the implementation, including relay and peer
testing. We are enabling it by default for Android and ARM platforms,
and a small percentage of other routers at random. This will allow us to
do much more testing in the next three months, finish the connection
migration feature, and fix any remaining issues. We plan to enable it
for everyone in the next release scheduled for November. No manual
configuration is necessary. Of course, there\'s the usual collection of
bug fixes in this release as well. We also added an automatic deadlock
detector that has already found a rare deadlock that is now fixed. {%-

{% trans -%} As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The
best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest
release. {%- endtrans %}

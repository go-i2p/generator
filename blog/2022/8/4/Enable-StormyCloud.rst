How to Switch to the StormyCloud Outproxy Service
{%- endtrans %}
=================================================

**{% trans %}A New, Professional Outproxy{% endtrans %}**

{% trans -%}
For years, I2P has been served by a single default outproxy, `false.i2p`
whose reliability has been degrading. Although several competitors
have emerged to take up some of the slack, they are mostly unable to
volunteer to serve the clients of an entire I2P implementation by
default. However, StormyCloud, a professional, non-profit organization
which runs Tor exit nodes, has started a new, professional outproxy
service which has been tested by members of the I2P community and which
will become the new default outproxy in the upcoming release.

<http://127.0.0.1:7657/i2ptunnel/edit?tunnel=0>`_. Once you're there, you should change
the value of **Outproxies** and **SSL Outproxies** to `exit.stormycloud.i2p`. Once you
have done this, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the "Save" button.

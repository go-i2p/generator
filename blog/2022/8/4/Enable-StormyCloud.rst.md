{% trans -%} How to Switch to the StormyCloud Outproxy Service {%-
endtrans %} =================================================

**A New, Professional Outproxy**

{% trans -%} For years, I2P has been served by a single default
outproxy, false.i2p whose reliability has been degrading. Although
several competitors have emerged to take up some of the slack, they are
mostly unable to volunteer to serve the clients of an entire I2P
implementation by default. However, StormyCloud, a professional,
non-profit organization which runs Tor exit nodes, has started a new,
professional outproxy service which has been tested by members of the
I2P community and which will become the new default outproxy in the
upcoming release. {%- endtrans %}

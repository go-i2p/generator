============================================

The I2P Easy-Install bundle for Windows has been released. In this
release, support has been added for most major browsers, including all
major Firefox(Gecko) and Chromium forks. Compatibility with external I2P
Service installs and un-bundled I2P user installs has been improved. The
Easy-Install bundle can now detect other I2P routers and prompt the user
to launch them instead, if they already have I2P. The browser extensions
have been updated to the latest versions. The Easy-Install now has
access to i2p.plugins.firefox\'s usability mode via the -usability
command-line flag. The default mode is the \"Strict\" mode where
Javascript is disabled by NoScript. In usability mode, Javascript is
restricted by JShelter. For more details, see the profile manager
repository at i2pgit.org.

It is recommended that you update to this release for the best security,
privacy, and performance, and to help the network.

Due to the departure of the developer/maintainer, the Easy-Install
Bundle for OSX will be delayed by a month while we work out the
maintainership.

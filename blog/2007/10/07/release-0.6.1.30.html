Hi y'all, there's a new I2P release available for your enjoyment at
http://www.i2p.net/download

This release includes some experimental tunnel throughput enhancements,
eepget fixes, network backlog handling, i2psnark fixes, among other
changes.  As always, a full list of changes can be found at
http://dev.i2p.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/i2p/history.txt?rev=HEAD

This release is backwards compatible, and upgrading shouldn't be a
problem.

Thanks go to zzz and Complication for their work making all these
changes happen!

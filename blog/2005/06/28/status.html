Hi y'all, weekly update time again

* Index
1) SSU status
2) Unit test status
3) Kaffe status
4) ???

* 1) SSU status

There has been some more progress on the SSU transport, and my
current thinking will be that after some more live net testing,
we'll be able to deploy as 0.6 without much delay.  The first
SSU release will not include support for people who cannot poke a
hole in their firewall or adjust their NAT, but that will be rolled
out in 0.6.1.  After 0.6.1 is out, tested, and kicking ass (aka
0.6.1.42), we'll move on over to 1.0.

My personal leaning is towards dropping the TCP transport completely
as the SSU transport rolls out so that people won't need to have
both enabled (forwarding both TCP and UDP ports) and so that the
coders won't need to maintain code that isn't necessary.  Anyone
have any strong feelings on this?

* 2) Unit test status

As mentioned last week, Comwiz has come forward to claim the first
phase of the unit test bounty (yay Comwiz!  thanks duck &amp; zab for
funding the bounty too!).  The code has been committed to CVS and,
depending on your local setup, you may be able to generate the junit
and clover reports by going into the i2p/core/java directory and
running &quot;ant test junit.report&quot; (wait about an hour...) and view
i2p/reports/core/html/junit/index.html.  On the other hand, you can
run &quot;ant useclover test junit.report clover.report&quot; and view
i2p/reports/core/html/clover/index.html.

The downside to both sets of tests has to do with that foolish
concept the ruling class calls &quot;copyright law&quot;.  Clover is a
commercial product, though the folks over at cenqua allow its free
use by open source developers (and they have kindly agreed to grant
us a license).  To generate the clover reports, you need to have
clover installed locally - I have clover.jar in ~/.ant/lib/, next to
my license file.  Most people won't need clover, and since we'll be
publishing the reports on the web, there is no loss of functionality
by not installing it.

On the other hand, we're being bit by the other side of copyright
law when we take into consideration the unit test framework itself -
junit is released under the IBM Common Public License 1.0, which,
according to the FSF [1], is not GPL compatible.  Now, while we
don't have any GPL code ourselves (at least not in the core or the
router), looking back at our license policy [2], our aim in the
particulars of how we license things is to allow as many people as
possible to use what is being created, since anonymity loves
company.

[2]<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.i2p.net/licenses">http://www.i2p.net/licenses</a>

Since some people inexplicably release software under the GPL, it
makes sense for us to strive to allow them to use I2P without
constraint.  At the very least, that means we can't allow the
actual functionality we expose to be dependent upon the CPL'ed
code (e.g. junit.framework.*).  I'd like to extend that to include
the unit tests as well, but junit seems to be the lingua franca of
testing frameworks (and I don't think it'd be anywhere near sane to
say &quot;hey, lets build our own public domain unit test framework!&quot;,
given our resources).

Given all that, here's what I'm thinking.  We'll bundle junit.jar in
CVS and use it when people run the unit tests, but the unit tests
themselves will not be built into i2p.jar or router.jar, and will
not be pushed out in releases.  We may expose an additional set of
jars (i2p-test.jar and router-test.jar), if necessary, but those
would not be usable by GPL'ed applications (since they depend upon
junit).

Any thoughts on that?  (How are GPL'ed apps using junit?  Simply
ignoring the FSF's view that the licenses are incompatible?)

* 3) Kaffe status

Yesterday while doing some SSU testing I decided to fire up a kaffe
instance and kick the tires a bit.  The results were promising, but
there's going to be work ahead of us - their UDP code has some minor
threading issues [3], and their java lib breaks xerces [4], which we
use for jetty [5].  As there are no xerces-specific dependencies,
we just need to snag another kaffe compatible xml engine -
Dalibor [6] has suggested either GNU JAXP [7] or saxon [8].  While
GNU JAXP has been merged into GNU/Classpath, its also still
available separately under GPL + linking exception (which is fine
for us), so it looks like a promising replacement for xerces.jar.

Anyone want to look into testing that out on a few JVMs and OSes
while I continue hacking on SSU, with the aim of getting the
router console working with kaffe + GNU JAXP - xerces.jar?

* 4) ???

Lots going on, and I'll keep y'all updated as more news becomes
available.  I still havent found a good late night net cafe, so
won't be around for a meeting tonight, but, as always, if anyone
has anything to bring up, feel free to post on the list or the
forum.

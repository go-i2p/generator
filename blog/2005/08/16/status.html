Hi y'all, brief notes today

* Index:
1) PeerTest status
2) Irc2P
3) Feedspace
4) meta
5) ???

* 1) PeerTest status

As mentioned before, the upcoming 0.6.1 release will include a series
of tests to more carefully configure the router and to verify
reachability (or point out what needs to be done), and while we've
had some code in CVS for two builds now, there are still some
refinements left before it'll work as smoothly as necessary.  At the
moment, I'm making some slight modifications to the test flow
documented [1] by adding in an additional packet to verify Charlie's
reachability and delaying Bob's reply to Alice until Charlie has
responded.  This should reduce the number of unnecessary &quot;ERR-Reject&quot;
status values people see as Bob won't reply to Alice until he has a
Charlie who is up for testing (and when Bob doesn't reply, Alice sees
&quot;Unknown&quot; as the status).

Anyway, yeah, thats that - there should be a 0.6.0.2-3 out tomorrow,
pushed as a release when its thoroughly tested.

* 2) Irc2P

As mentioned on the forum [2], I2P users who use IRC need to update
their configuration to switch over to the new IRC network.  Duck will
be going offline temporarily to [redacted], and rather than hope the
server doesn't have any trouble during that time, postman and smeghead
have stepped up and built a new IRC network for your use.  Postman
has also mirrored duck's tracker and i2p-bt site at [3], and I think
I saw something on the new IRC network about susi firing up a new
IdleRPG instance (check the channel list for more info).

My thanks go out to those responsible for the old i2pirc network
(duck, baffled, the metropipe crew, postman) and to those responsible
for the new irc2p network (postman, arcturus)!  Interesting services
and content make I2P worthwhile, and its up to y'all to create 'em!

* 3) Feedspace

Speaking of which, I was reading through frosk's blog the other day
and it seems there's some more progress on Feedspace - in particular,
on a nice lil' GUI.  I know it might not be ready to test yet, but
I'm sure frosk'll bounce some code our way when its time.  As an
aside, I've also heard a rumor about another anonymity-aware web
based blogging tool in the pipeline which'll be able to tie into
Feedspace when its ready, but again, I'm sure we'll hear more info on
that when its ready.

* 4) meta

Being the greedy bastard that I am, I'd like to move the meetings up
a bit - instead of 9PM GMT, lets try 8PM GMT.  Why?  Because it fits
my schedule better ;) (the closest net cafes aren't open too late).

* 5) ???

Thats about it for the moment - I'm going to try to be near a net cafe
for tonight's meeting, so feel free to swing on by #i2p at *8*P GMT on
the /new/ irc servers {irc.postman.i2p, irc.arcturus.i2p}.  We may
have a changate bot up to irc.freenode.net - anyone want to run one?

ciao,

Hi y'all, its that time of the week again

* Index
1) 0.6.0.2
2) roadmap update
3) ???

* 1) 0.6.0.2

As announced yesterday [1], we've got a new release out and
available and the reports are generally positive.  About half of y'all
have upgraded already (I see 110 @ 0.6.0.2, 89 @ 0.6.0.1, and 21 @
0.6), but the rest should upgrade asap, as there have been some
useful improvements.

* 2) Roadmap update

Earlier this afternoon I thought it'd make sense to transcribe a
summary of the roadmap from my notebook to the web, so those of you
wondering whats up and where we're going can now swing on over to
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.i2p.net/roadmap">http://www.i2p.net/roadmap</a> and see whats been changed.  Its nothing
revolutionary, but should help clarify things for people.

One thing that may be worth noting (beyond the lack of dates) is that
after 0.6.1 stabalizes, we'll probably want to focus on some heavier
tests and improving the end user experience - both with i2p and with
i2p enabled applications.  0.6.2 and beyond will bring great stuff
too, but they'll primarily improve the ability for more people to get
on I2P rather than change the fundamentals.

* 3) ???

Theres lots and lots more going on out there, such as some updates on
the whole irc setup, feedspace/mnet progress, Connelly's analysis and
XML-RPC futures, etc, but I'm sure we'll get more info on things when
there's relevent info to share.  I will be able to make it to the
meeting again this week, so swing on by #i2p on {irc.duck.i2p,
irc.postman.i2p, irc.freenode.net} at 9p GMT and rant away!

Hi y'all, time for the weekly status notes again

* 1) 0.6.0.3 status

As mentioned the other day [1], we've got a new 0.6.0.3 release out
there, ready for your enjoyment.  Its a big improvement from the
0.6.0.2 release (its not uncommon to get several days without
disconnect on irc - I've had 5 day uptimes broken by an upgrade),
but there are a few things worth noting.  Still, its not always like
that - people with slow net connections run into troubles, but its
progress.

One (very) common question has come up regarding the peer test code-
&quot;Why does it say Status: Unknown?&quot;  Unknown is *perfectly fine* - it
is NOT indicitive of a problem.  Also, if you see it sometimes go
between &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;ERR-Reject&quot;, that DOESN'T mean its ok - if you ever
see ERR-Reject, that means its very likely that you've got a NAT or
firewall issue.  I know its confusing, and there'll be a release
later with clearer status display (and automatic resolution, when
possible), but for now, don't be suprised if I ignore you when you
say &quot;omg its broken!!!11 the status is Unknown!&quot; ;)

(The cause for the excess Unknown status values is because we are
ignoring peer tests where &quot;Charlie&quot; [2] is someone we already have
an SSU session with, since that implies they'd be able to get
through our NAT even if our NAT is broken)

* 2) IRC status

As mentioned above, the Irc2P operators have done a great job with
their network, as latency is way down and reliability way up - I
haven't seen a netsplit in days.  There's also a new irc server on
there, giving us 3 - irc.postman.i2p, irc.arcturus.i2p, and
irc.freshcoffee.i2p.  Perhaps one of the Irc2P folks can give us an
update on their progress during the meeting?

* 3) susibt

susi23 (of susimail fame) is back with a pair of bt related tools -
susibt [3] and a new tracker bot [4].  susibt is a web application
(trivially deployable in your i2p jetty instance) for managing
i2p-bt's operation.  As her site says:

  SusiBT is a web frontend for i2p-bt. It integrates into your i2p
  router and allows for automatic up- and downloads, resumes after
  restart and some management functionality like file up- and
  download. Later versions of the application will support automatic
  build and upload of torrent files.

Can I hear a &quot;w00t&quot;?

* 4) Syndie

As mentioned on the list and in the channel, we've got a new
client app for secure and authenticated blogging / content
distribution.  With Syndie, the &quot;is your eepsite(I2P Site) up&quot; question goes
away, as you can read the content even when the site is down, but
Syndie avoids all the ugly issues inherent in content distribution
networks by focusing on the frontend.  Anyway, its very much a work
in progress, but if people want to get in and try it out, there's
a public Syndie node at <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://syndiemedia.i2p/">http://syndiemedia.i2p/</a> (also reachable on
the web at <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://66.111.51.110:8000/">http://66.111.51.110:8000/</a>).   Feel free to go in there
and create a blog, or if you're feeling adventurous, blog up some
comments/suggestions/concerns!  Of course, patches are welcome, but
so are feature suggestions, so let 'er rip.

* 5) ???

Saying lots going on is a bit of an understatement... beyond the
above, I'm hacking on some improvements to SSU's congestion control
(-1 is in cvs already), our bandwidth limiter, and the netDb (for
the occational site unreachability), as well as debugging the CPU
issue reported on the forum.  I'm sure others are hacking on some
cool things to report as well, so hopefully they'll swing by the
meeting tonight to rant away :)

Anyway, see y'all tonight at 8pm GMT in #i2p on the usual servers!

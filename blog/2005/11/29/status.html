* 1) Net status and 0.6.1.6

Another week, another release.  The network seems reasonably well
behaved, and with 60+% of the routers up to date, there does appear
to be a noticeable improvement in performance, at least from the
perspective of bandwidth efficiency and end to end throughput.  Its
still not where I'd like it to be, but we're getting there.

There have been some issues with the latest release though,
including some bugs I unintentionally injected into Raccoon23's
dynamic keys patch.  Those have been corrected in CVS though, and we
should have a 0.6.1.7 release out in the next day or two (which will
include some other neat stuff as well).  If you haven't run into
trouble, then don't worry, and if you don't know if you've run into
trouble, you haven't :)

One thing I'm considering for 0.6.1.7 is perhaps dropping support
for the TCP transport (at least for normal communication).  The
general idea is that we can use the TCP transport for people's
restricted routes / trusted links, but not to require it for general
network operation, as we do for SSU.  This'll only happen if I can
get some issues resolved cleanly, so it might not make it into
0.6.1.7, but its on the short list of things to do.  You've been
warned :)

* 2) Syndie

There is lots of progress on the Syndie front as well, though some
important bits are going on within Syndie itself.  If you haven't
checked it out yet, swing by the roadmap thread [1], or some of the
other threads posted recently.  I've also posted up some basic info
on how syndie works behind the scenes, and will be expanding upon
that in the coming days [2].

* 3) I2P Rufus 0.0.4

Rawn and defnax have done it again with a new I2P Rufus release [3].
Looks like some good progress over there, nice work y'all!

* 4) ???

There's some interesting stuff coming down the pipe, and we're
making some good progress clearing issues to get us towards 0.6.2
and beyond.  As always, swing on by the meeting tonight to discuss
things further - #i2p at 8p UTC!

* 1) Net status / short term roadmap

0.6.1.4 still seems pretty solid, though there have been some
bugfixes in CVS since then.  I've also added some optimizations
for SSU to transfer data more efficiently, which I hope will have a
noticeable impact on the network once its rolled out widely.  I'm
holding off on 0.6.1.5 for the moment though, as there are a few
other things I want to get into the next release.  The current plan
is to push it out this weekend, so keep an ear out for the latest
news.

The 0.6.2 release will include lots of great stuff to face even
stronger adversaries, but one thing it won't affect is performance.
While anonymity is certainly the entire point of I2P, if the
throughput and latency is poor, we won't have any users.  As such,
my plan is to get performance where it needs to be before proceeding
on to implementing the 0.6.2 peer ordering strategies and the new
tunnel creation techniques.

* 2) I2Phex

There's been lots of activity on the I2Phex front as of late too,
with a new 0.1.1.35 release [1].  There have also been further
changes in CVS as well (thanks Legion!), so I wouldn't be suprised
to see a 0.1.1.36 later this week.

There has been some good progress on the gwebcache front too (see
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://awup.i2p/">http://awup.i2p/</a>), though no one to my knowledge has started working
on modifying I2Phex to use an I2P-enabled gwebcache (interested?
lemmie know!)

* 3) I2P-Rufus

Word on the street is defnax and Rawn have been doing some hacking
on the Rufus BT client, merging in some I2P related code from
I2P-BT.  I don't know the current status of the port, but it sounds
like it'll have some nice features.  I'm sure we'll hear more when
there's more to be heard.

* 4) I2PSnarkGUI

Another rumor going around is Markus has been doing some hacking on
a new C# GUI... screenshots on PlanetPeer look pretty cool [2].
There are still plans for a platform independent web interface, but
this looks pretty nice.  I'm sure we'll hear more from Markus as the
GUI progresses.

* 5) Syndie

There has also been some discussion going on regarding Syndie UI
revamps [3], and I expect we'll see some progress on that front
fairly soon.  dust is also crunching away on Sucker, adding better
support for pulling more RSS/Atom feeds into Syndie, as well as some
enhancements to SML itself.

* 6) ???

Lots and lots going on, as always.  Swing on by #i2p in a few
minutes for our weekly dev meeting.

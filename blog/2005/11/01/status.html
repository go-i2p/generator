Hi y'all, its that time of the week again

* Index
1) 0.6.1.4 and net status
2) boostraps, predecessors, global passive adversaries, and CBR
3) i2phex 0.1.1.34
4) voi2p app
5) syndie and sucker
6) ???

* 1) 0.6.1.4 and net status

Last saturday's 0.6.1.4 release seems to have gone fairly smoothly -
75% of the network has upgraded already (thanks!), and most of the
remaining are on 0.6.1.3 anyway.  Things seems to be working
reasonably well, and while I haven't heard much feedback about it -
either positive or negative, I'm assuming y'all would complain
loudly if it were bad :)

In particular, I'd be interested in hearing any feedback from people
on dialup modem connections, as the testing I've done is only a
basic simulation of that sort of connection.

* 2) bootstraps, predecessors, global passive adversaries, and CBR

There's been lots more discussion on the list regarding a few ideas,
with a summary of the bootstrap attacks up online [1].  I've made
some progress specing out the crypto for option 3, and while nothing
has been posted yet, its fairly straightforward.

There have been further discussions about how to improve resistance
to powerful adversaries with constant bitrate (CBR) tunnels, and
while we have the option to explore that avenue, its currently
slated for I2P 3.0, as its proper use requires substantial
resources, and would likely have a measureable impact on who would
be willing to use I2P with such overhead as well as what groups
would or would not even be able to.

* 3) I2Phex 0.1.1.34

Last saturday we also had a new I2Phex release [2], fixing a file
descriptor leak which would eventually cause I2Phex to fail (thanks
Complication!) and removing some code which would allow people to
remotely tell your I2Phex instance to download some particular
files (thanks GregorK!).  Upgrading is highly recommended.

There's also been an update to the CVS version (not yet released)
which clears up some synchronization issues - Phex assumes some
network operations are processed immediately, while I2P can sometime
take a while to do things :)  This manifests itself with the GUI
hanging for a while, downloads or uploads stalling, or connections
being refused (and perhaps a few other ways).  It hasn't had much
testing yet, but will probably be pushed out into 0.1.1.35 this
week.  I'm sure more news will be posted on the forum when there's
more news.

* 4) voi2p app

Aum is churning away on his new voice (and text) over I2P app, and
while I haven't seen it yet, it sounds neat.  Perhaps Aum can give
us an update in the meeting, or we can just wait patiently for the
first alpha release :)

* 5) syndie and sucker

dust has been working away on syndie and sucker, and the latest CVS
build of I2P now lets you automatically pull in content from RSS and
atom feeds and post them to your syndie blog.  At the moment, you've
got to explicitly add lib/rome-0.7.jar and lib/jdom.jar to your
wrapper.config (wrapper.java.classpath.20 and 21), but we'll bundle
it up so that isn't necessary later.  Its still a work in progress,
and rome 0.8 (not yet released) seems to offer some really cool
stuff, such as the ability to snag the enclosures off a feed, which
sucker will then be able to import as an attachment to a syndie
post (right now it already handles images and links too though!)

Like all rss feeds, there seem to be some discrepencies with how the
content is included, so some feeds go in smoother than others.  I
think if people were to help test it out with different feeds and
let dust know of any issues that it b0rks on, that might be useful.
In any case, this stuff looks pretty exciting, nice work dust!

* 6) ???

Thats about it for the moment, but if anyone has any questions or
wants to discuss some things further, swing on by the meeting at 8P
GMT (remember, daylight savings!)

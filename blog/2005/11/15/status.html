Hi y'all, time for our weekly status notes

* Index
1) Net status / 0.6.1.5
2) Syndie updates
3) I2Phex
4) I2P-Rufus
5) Issue tracker
6) ???

* 1) Net status / 0.6.1.5

The past week on the network has been pretty solid, and the other
day stats.i2p logged more than 2000 unique routers on I2P over the
past two weeks.  The stable network size has only gradually grown,
but its nice to see I2P handling high churn rates without much
trouble.

There will be a new 0.6.1.5 release tonight with a whole bunch of
changes, including a fairly heavily revamped Syndie, so keep an
eye on the list, the forum, or the website for an announcement.

* 2) Syndie updates

As mentioned, we'll be bundling an updated Syndie tonight with 
changes to the user interface, integration of dust's Sucker (for
importing RSS/Atom into Syndie), and Ragnarok's updater (for
scheduled synchronization).  Based on CofE's suggestion, Syndie will
also default to &quot;single user mode&quot; and log in automatically to a
default account.  People with existing Syndie logins can configure
which account to log into automatically (see admin.jsp), though
Syndie instances in multiuser mode (namely syndiemedia.i2p,
glog.i2p, and gloinsblog.i2p) behave much like before.

Another feature of the update is we will pull posts off those three
multiuser Syndie instances automatically by default, using the
HTTP proxy configured on config.jsp, which defaults to the eepproxy.
Of course, this can be changed by simply going to the addressbook
and unchecking the &quot;Syndicate?&quot; checkbox.

There's a lot more to Syndie in this release as well, so I encourage
people to give it a spin once you upgrade to 0.6.1.5.  You can also
get a glimpse of how it works on syndiemedia [1] (with an updated
intro doc @ [2]), though functionality is limited when you're not
logged in as an administrator.

* 3) I2Phex

Just a short note saying that 0.1.1.36 will be coming out later this
evening as well, including the latest bugfix for that &quot;Please insert
a disk&quot; popup.  Check the forum for news.

* 4) I2P-Rufus

defnax and Rawn have put together another I2P-Rufus release [2],
available at defnax's site [3] or awup's mirror [4]

* 5) Issue tracker

As mentioned on my blog [5], I'm looking for a good issue tracking
package for I2P/et al, without the hassles of bugzilla.  Cervantes
came up with an interesting solution [6] which has some really cool
benefits, but I'd be interested to hear what other people think too.
(perhaps post up your thoughts to syndie :)

Lots and lots going on, as always.  Swing on by #i2p in a few
minutes for our weekly dev meeting, and check the website and forum
later tonight for the 0.6.1.5 announcement!

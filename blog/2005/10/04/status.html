Hi y'all, time for our weekly status notes (insert cheering here)

* Index
1) 0.6.1.1
2) i2phex
3) syndie
4) ???

* 1) 0.6.1.1

As announced on the usual places, 0.6.1.1 came out the other day, and
so far, reports have been positive.  The network has grown to a
steady 3-400 known peers, and performance has been pretty good,
though cpu usage has increased a bit.  This is probably be due to a 
long standing bugs which incorrectly allows invalid IP addresses to get
accepted, which in turn causes a higher than necessary churn.  There
have been fixes to this and other things in CVS builds since 0.6.1.1,
so we'll probably have a 0.6.1.2 later this week.

* 2) i2phex

While some may have noticed the discussion on various forums
regarding i2phex and legion's fork, there has been additional 
communication between myself and legion, and we're working on merging
the two back together.  More info on this when its available.

In addition, redzara is hacking away on merging i2phex with the
current phex release, and striker has come up with some further
improvements, so there's some exciting stuff coming down the pipe.

* 3) syndie

Ragnarok has been working away on syndie the last few days, 
integrating syndie's pet name database with the router's, as well
as automating the syndication with scheduled pulls from selected
remote archives.  The automation part is done, and while there's
some UI work left, its in pretty good shape!  

* 4) ???

There is a lot else going on these days too, including some work on
the new tech intro docs, irc migration, and website revamping.  If
anyone has anything they'd like to bring up, swing on by the meeting
in a few minutes and say hey!

* 1) 0.6.1.2

Last week's 0.6.1.2 release has gone pretty well so far - 75% of the
network has upgraded, HTTP POST is working fine, and the streaming
lib is pushing data reasonably efficiently (the full response to an
HTTP request is often received in a single end to end round trip).
The network has also grown a bit - steady numbers look like 400-ish
peers, though it bursted up a bit further to 6-700 with churn during
the peak of the digg/gotroot [1] reference over the weekend.

    (yeah, really old article, I know, but someone found it again)

Since 0.6.1.2 came out, there has been even more good stuff added
in - the cause of the recent irc2p netsplits has been found (and
fixed), as have some pretty hefty improvements upon SSU's packet
transmission (saving upwards of 5% of the packets).  I'm not sure
exactly when 0.6.1.3 will come out, but maybe later this week.
We'll see.

* 2) I2PTunnelIRCClient

The other day, after some discussion, dust whipped up a new extension
to I2PTunnel - the &quot;ircclient&quot; proxy.  It works by filtering the
content sent and received between the client and server over I2P, 
stripping unsafe IRC messages and rewriting ones that should be
adjusted.  After some testing, its looking quite good, and dust has
contributed it to I2PTunnel and its now offered to people through the
web interface.  Its been great that the irc2p folks have patched up
their IRC servers to drop unsafe messages, but now we don't have to
trust them to do so anymore - the local user has control over their
own filtering.

Using it is quite easy - instead of building a &quot;Client proxy&quot; for IRC
as before, just build an &quot;IRC proxy&quot;.  If you want to convert your 
existing &quot;Client proxy&quot; to an &quot;IRC proxy&quot;, you can (cringe) edit the
i2ptunnel.config file, changing the &quot;tunnel.1.type=client&quot; to
&quot;tunnel.1.ircclient&quot; (or whatever number is appropriate for your
proxy).

If things go well, this will be made the default I2PTunnel proxy type
for IRC connections in the next release.

Nice work dust, thanks!

* 3) Syndie

Ragnarok's scheduled syndication feature seems to be going well, and
since 0.6.1.2 came out, there have been two new features coming
forward - I've added in a new simplified CLI to post into Syndie [2],
and dust (yay dust!) has whipped up some code to pull content out of
an RSS/Atom feed, pull in any enclosures or images referenced in it,
and convert the RSS content to SML (!!!) [3][4].

The implications of these two together should be clear.  More news
when there's more news.

    (we'll get it integrated into CVS soon enough)

* 4) I2Phex

Word on the street is that I2Phex is working pretty well, but that
issues over time still persist.  There has been some discussion on
the forum [5] regarding how to proceed, and GregorK, the lead 
Phex dev, has even chimed in to voice support of integrating the
I2Phex functionality back into Phex (or at least let the mainline
Phex offer a simple plugin interface for the transport layer).

This would be really quite kickass, as it'd mean much less code to
maintain, plus we'd get the benefit of the Phex team's work on 
improving the codebase.  However, for this to work, we need some 
hackers to come forward and take charge of the migration.  The
I2Phex code makes pretty clear where sirup changed things, so it
shouldn't be too hard, but its probably not quite trivial either ;)

I don't really have time to jump on this right now, but swing by
the forum if you want to help.

* 5) Stego and darknets (re: flamewar)

The mailing list [6] has been pretty active as of late with the
discussion regarding steganography and darknets.  The topic has
moved largely over to the Freenet tech list [7] under the subject
&quot;I2P conspiracy theories flamewar&quot;, but its still ongoing.

I'm not sure I have much to add that isn't part of the posts
themselves, but some people have mentioned that the discussion has
helped with their understanding of I2P and Freenet, so it might be
worth browsing.  Or maybe not ;)

* 6) ???

As you can see, lots of exciting stuff going on, and I'm sure I've
missed some things.  Swing on by #i2p in a few minutes for our 
weekly meeting and say hey!

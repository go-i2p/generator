Hi gang, its tuesday again

* Index:
1) 0.6.0.6

3) migration
4) ???

* 1) 0.6.0.6

With last saturday's 0.6.0.6 release, we've got a bunch of new
pieces in play on the live net, and y'all have done a great job
upgrading - as of a few hours ago, almost 250 routers have upgraded!
The network seems to be doing well too, and introductions have so far
been working - you can track your own introduction activity with the
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://localhost:7657/oldstats.jsp">http://localhost:7657/oldstats.jsp</a>, looking at the
udp.receiveHolePunch and udp.receiveIntroRelayResponse (as well as
udp.receiveRelayIntro, for those behind NATs).  

btw, the &quot;Status: ERR-Reject&quot; now really isn't an error, so
perhaps we should change it to &quot;Status: OK (NAT)&quot;?

There have been a few bug reports with Syndie.  Most recently, there
is a bug were it will fail to sync up with remote peers if you ask
it to download too many entries at once (since I foolishly used HTTP
GET instead of POST).  I'll be adding support for POST to EepGet,
but in the meantime, try pulling just 20 or 30 posts at a time.
As an aside, perhaps someone can come up with the javascript for the
remote.jsp page to say &quot;fetch all posts from this user&quot;, 
automatically checking all of their blog's checkboxes?

Word on the street is that OSX works fine out of the box now, and
with 0.6.0.6-1, x86_64 is operational too on both windows and linux.
I haven't heard any reports of problems with the new .exe installers,
so either that means its going well or failing completely :)

* 2) I2Phex 0.1.1.27

Prompted by some reports of differences between the source and what
was bundled in legion's packaging of 0.1.1.26, as well as concern
for the safety of the closed source native launcher, I've gone 
ahead and added a new launch4j [1] built i2phex.exe to cvs and built
the latest from cvs on the i2p file archive [2].  It is unknown 
whether there are other changes made by legion to his source code
prior to his release, or whether the source code he put out is in
fact the same as what he built.

For security purposes, I cannot recommend the use of either legion's
closed source launcher or the 0.1.1.26 release.  The release on the
I2P website [2] contains the latest code from cvs, without
modification.

You can reproduce the build by first checking out and building the
I2P code, then checking out the I2Phex code, then running 
&quot;ant makeRelease&quot;:
  mkdir ~/devi2p ; cd ~/devi2p/
  cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs-PQcCzt6076/R7s880joybQ@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/cvsroot login 
# (pw: anoncvs)
  cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs-PQcCzt6076/R7s880joybQ@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/cvsroot co i2p
  cd i2p ; ant build ; cd ..
  cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs-PQcCzt6076/R7s880joybQ@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/cvsroot co 
i2phex
  cd i2phex/build ; ant makeRelease ; cd ../..
  ls -l i2phex/release/i2phex-0.1.1.27.zip

The i2phex.exe inside that zip is usable on windows by simply
running it, or on *nix/osx via &quot;java -jar i2phex.exe&quot;.  It does 
depend upon I2Phex being installed in a directory next to I2P -
(e.g. C:\Program Files\i2phex\ and C:\Program Files\i2p\), as it
references some of I2P's jar files.

I'm not stepping in to maintain I2Phex, but I will put future I2Phex
releases on the website when there are updates to cvs.  If someone
wants to work on a webpage that we can put up to describe/introduce
it (sirup, you out there?), with links to sirup.i2p, useful forum 
posts, legion's list of active peers, that'd be great.

* 3) migration

We've switched colo boxes for the i2p services, but everything 
should now be fully operational on the new machine - if you see 
something funky, please, let me know!

* 4) ???

There has been a lot of interesting discussion on the i2p list as of
late, Adam's neat new smtp proxy/filter, as well as some good posts
on syndie (seen gloin's skin on <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://gloinsblog.i2p">http://gloinsblog.i2p</a>?)  I'm working
on some changes at the moment for some long standing issues, but
those aren't imminent.  If anyone has anything else they want to
bring up and discuss, swing on by the meeting in #i2p at 8p GMT (in
10 minutes or so).

Hi y'all, brief update this week

* Index
1) SSU testing progress
2) ???

* 1) SSU testing

We've been doing lots of tweaking and bugfixing since this second round
of SSU testing started, but its looking more and more positive.  There
are around 20-30 people participating in the tests (or at least running
SSU-enabled routers), and the performance is much better than I had hoped.
There are still some bugs being tracked down, but we're getting close to
the point where we can push 'er out into 0.6 to get full network testing.

The current CVS head is 0.5.0.7-16, though by the time you read this it
may have increased again, so please pull from CVS if you're testing.  If
you're holding off until the 0.6 release, have patience ;)

* 2) ???

Thats it for the moment, and yeah, still no meeting this week (though
there's a chance that they'll be back in two weeks or so... not sure
yet).  As always, if someone has something to bring up, please don't
hesitate to post it on the list or on the forum.

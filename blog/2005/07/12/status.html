Hi y'all, its that time of the week again

* Index
1) squid/www/cvs/dev.i2p restored
2) SSU testing
3) I2CP crypto
4) ???

* 1) squid/www/cvs/dev.i2p restored

After bashing my head on several colo boxes, some of the old services
have been restored - squid.i2p (one of the two default outproxies),
www.i2p (a secure pointer to www.i2p.net), dev.i2p (a secure
pointer to dev.i2p.net, where the mailing list archives, cvsweb, and
default netDb seeds are found), and cvs.i2p (a secure pointer to our
CVS server - cvs.i2p.net:2401).  My blog is still awol, but its
content was lost anyway so there'll need to be a fresh start sooner
or later.  Now that these services are back online reliably, its
time to move on to the...

* 2) SSU testing

As mentioned in that little yellow box on everyone's router console,
we've begun the next round of live network testing for SSU.  The
tests are not for everyone, but if you're adventurous and are
comfortable doing some manual configuration, check out the details
referenced on your router console (<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://localhost:7657/index.jsp">http://localhost:7657/index.jsp</a>).
There may be several rounds of testing, but I don't forsee any major
changes to SSU prior to the 0.6 release (0.6.1 will add support for
those who cannot forward their ports or otherwise receive inbound
UDP connections).

* 3) I2CP crypto

While working over the new introductory docs again, I'm having a bit
of trouble justifying the additional layer of encryption done within
the I2CP SDK.  The original intent of the I2CP crypto layer was to
provide a baseline end to end protection of the messages transmitted,
as well as to allow I2CP clients (aka I2PTunnel, the SAM bridge,
I2Phex, azneti2p, etc) to communicate through untrusted routers.  As
the implementation progressed however, the I2CP layer's end to end
protection has become redundant, as all client messages are end to
end encrypted inside garlic messages by the router, bundling the
sender's leaseSet and sometimes a delivery status message.  This
garlic layer already provides end to end encryption from the sender's
router to the receiver's router - the only difference is that it
doesn't protect against that router itself being hostile.

Looking at the forseable use cases however, I can't seem to come up
with a valid scenario where the local router wouldn't be trusted.
At the very least, the I2CP crypto only hides the content of the
message transmitted from the router - the router still needs to know
to what destination it should be sent.  If necessary, we can add an
SSH/SSL I2CP listener to allow the I2CP client and the router to
operate on separate machines, or people who need such situations can
use existing tunnelling tools.

Just to reiterate the crypto layering used right now, we have:
 * I2CP's end to end ElGamal/AES+SessionTag layer, encrypting from
   the sender's destination to the recipient's destination.
 * The router's end to end garlic encryption layer
   (ElGamal/AES+SessionTag), encrypting from the sender's router to
   the recipient's router.
 * The tunnel encryption layer for both the inbound and outbound
   tunnels at the hops along each (but not between the outbound
   endpoint and the inbound gateway).
 * The transport encryption layer between each router.

I want to be fairly cautious about dropping one of those layers, but
I don't want to waste our resources doing unnecessary work.  What
I'm proposing is dropping that first I2CP encryption layer (but
still of course keeping the authentication used during I2CP session
establishment, leaseSet authorization, and sender authentication).
Can anyone come up with a reason why we should keep it?

* 4) ???

Thats about it for the moment, but lots going on as always.  Still
no meeting this week, but if someone has something to bring up,
please don't hesitate to post it on the list or on the forum.  Also,
while I do read the scrollback in #i2p, general questions or
concerns should be sent to the list instead so that more people can
participate in the discussion.

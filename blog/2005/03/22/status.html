Hi y'all, quick status update

* Index
1) 0.5.0.3
2) batching
3) updating
4) ???

* 0.5.0.3

The new release is out and about, and most of y'all have upgraded
fairly quickly - thanks!  There were some bugfixes to various
issues, but nothing revolutionary - the biggest part was dropping
0.5 and 0.5.0.1 users off the net.  I've been tracking the net's
behavior since then, digging through what's going on, and while
there has been some improvement, there are still some things that
need to get sorted out.

There'll be a new release in the next day or two with a bugfix for
an issue that no one has run into yet, but that breaks the new
batching code.  There will also be some tools for automating the
update process according to the user's preferences, along with other
minor things.

* batching

As I mentioned in my blog, there's room for dramatically reducing
the bandwidth and message count required on the net by doing some
very simple batching of tunnel messages - rather than putting each
I2NP message, regardless of size, in a tunnel message of its own,
by adding in a brief delay we can bundle up to 15 or more within
a single tunnel message.  The biggest gains there will occur with
services that use small messages (such as IRC), while large file
transfers will not be affected by this much.  The code to perform
the batching has been implemented and tested, but unfortunately
there's a bug on the live net which would cause all but the first
I2NP message within a tunnel message to be lost.  Thats why we're
going to have an interim release with that fix in it, followed by
the batching release a week or so after that.

* updating

In this interim release, we're going to be shipping some of the
oft discussed 'autoupdate' code.  We've got the tools to
periodically check for authentic update announcements, download
the update either anonymously or not, and then either install it
or simply display a notice on the router console telling you that
its ready and waiting for installation.  The update itself will
now use smeghead's new signed update format which is essentially
the update plus a DSA signature.  The keys used to verify that
signature will be bundled with I2P, as well as configurable on
the router console.

The default behavior will be to simply periodically check for update
announcements but not to act on them - just to display a one-click
&quot;Update now&quot; feature on the router console.  There will be lots of
other scenarios for different user needs, but they'll hopefully all
be accounted for through a new configuration page.

* ???

I'm feeling a bit under the weather, so the above doesn't really go
into all the detail about whats up.  Swing on by the meeting and
fill in the gaps :)

Oh, as an aside, I'll be pushing out a new PGP key for myself in the
next day or two as well (since this one expires shortly...), so keep
an eye out.

* 1) Net status

Over the last week, much of my time has been spent analyzing the
network's behavior, tracking stats and trying to reproduce various
events in the simulator.  While some of the funky network behavior
can be attributed to the two dozen or so routers still on older
versions, the key factor is that our speed calculations aren't
giving us good data - we aren't able to properly identify peers who
can pump data quickly.  In the past, this wasn't much of a problem,
since there was a bug causing us to use the 8 highest capacity peers
as the 'fast' pool, rather than building legitimate capacity derived
tiers.  Our current speed calculation is derived from a periodic
latency test (the RTT of a tunnel test, in particular), but that
provides insufficient data to have any confidence in the value.
What we need is a better way to gather more data points while still
allowing 'high capacity' peers to be promoted to the 'fast' tier, as
necessary.

To verify that this is the key problem we're facing, I cheated a bit
and added functionality to manually select what peers should be used
in a particular tunnel pool's selection.  With those explicitly
chosen peers, I've had over two days on irc without disconnect and
fairly reasonable performance w/ another service I control.  For the
last two days or so, I've been trying out a new speed calculator
using some new stats, and while it has improved selection, it still
has some problems.  I've worked through a few alternatives this
afternoon, but there's still work to be done to try 'em out on the
net.

* 2) Feedspace

Frosk has put up another rev of the i2pcontent/fusenet docs, except
now at a new home with a new name: <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://feedspace.i2p/">http://feedspace.i2p/</a> - see
either orion [1] or my blog [2] for the destination.  This stuff
looks really promising, both from the perspective of &quot;hey, kickass
functionality&quot; and &quot;hey, that'll help I2P's anonymity&quot;.  Frosk and
gang are working away, but they're most certainly looking for input
(and help).  Perhaps we can get Frosk to give us an update in the
meeting?

Ok, it may not look like much, but there's lots going on, really :)
I'm sure I've missed some things too, so swing on by the meeting
and see whats up.

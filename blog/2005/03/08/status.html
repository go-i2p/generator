Hi y'all, weekly update time

* Index
1) 0.5.0.2
2) mail.i2p updates
3) i2p-bt updates
4) ???

* 1) 0.5.0.2

The other day we pushed out the 0.5.0.2 release and a good portion
of the network has upgraded (yay!)  Reports are coming in that the
worst offenders from 0.5.0.1 have been killed, and overall things
seem to be working fine.  There are still some reliability issues,
though the streaming lib has been handling it (irc connections
lasting for 12-24+ hours seems the norm).  I've been trying to
track down some of the issues remaining, but it would be really,
really good if everyone got up to date ASAP.

As things stand for moving forward, reliability is king.  Only after
an overwhelming majority of messages that should succeed do succeed
will there be work on improving throughput.  Beyond the batching
tunnel preprocessor, another dimension we may want to explore is
feeding more latency data into the profiles.  We currently only use
test and tunnel management messages to determine each peer's &quot;speed&quot;
ranking, but we should probably snag any measurable RTTs for other
actions, such as netDb and even end to end client messages.  On the
other hand, we'll have to weight them accordingly, since for an
end to end message, we cannot separate the four portions of the
measurable RTT (our outbound, their inbound, their outbound, our
inbound).  Perhaps we can do some garlic trickery to bundle a
message targetting one of our inbound tunnels along side some
outbound messages, cutting the other side's tunnels out of the
measurement loop.

* 2) mail.i2p updates

Ok, I don't know what updates postman has in store for us, but
there'll be an update during the meeting.  See the logs to find
out!

* 3) i2p-bt update

I don't know what updates duck &amp; gang have for us, but I've heard
some ruminations of progress on the channel.  Perhaps we can get
an update out of 'im.

* 4) ???

Lots and lots going on, but if there's anything in particular y'all
want to bring up and discuss, swing on by the meeting in a few
minutes.  Oh, and just a reminder, if you haven't upgraded yet,
please do so ASAP (upgrading is insanely simple - download a file,
click a button)

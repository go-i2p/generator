Hi y'all, time for the weekly update

* Index
1) 0.5.0.5
2) Bayesian peer profiling
3) Q
4) ???

* 1) 0.5.0.5

Last week's 0.5.0.5 release has had its ups and downs - the major
change to address some attacks in the netDb seems to work as
expected, but has exposed some long overlooked bugs in the netDb's
operation.  This has caused some substantial reliability issues,
especially for eepsites(I2P Sites).  The bugs have however been identified and
addressed in CVS, and those fixes among a few others will be pushed
out as a 0.5.0.6 release within the next day.

* 2) Bayesian peer profiling

bla has been doing some research into improving our peer profiling
by exploiting simple bayesian filtering from the gathered stats [1].
It looks quite promising, though I'm not sure where it stands at the
moment - perhaps we can get an update from bla during the meeting?

* 3) Q

There is lots of progress going on with aum's Q app, both in the
core functionality and with a few people building various xmlrpc
frontends.  Rumor has it we might be seeing another Q build out this
weekend with a whole slew of goodies described on <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://aum.i2p/q/">http://aum.i2p/q/</a>

* 4) ???

Ok, yeah, very brief status notes, as I got the timezones mixed up
*again* (actually, I got the days mixed up too, thought it was
Monday until a few hours ago).  Anyway, there is lots of stuff going
on not mentioned above, so swing on by the meeting and see whats up!

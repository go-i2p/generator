Hi y'all, brief weekly status notes today

* Index
1) Net status
2) SSU status
3) Unit test bounty
4) ???

* 1) Net status

Most people have upgraded to last weeks 0.5.0.7 release fairly
quickly (thanks!) and the overall result seems positive.  The net
seems fairly reliable and the previous tunnel throttling has been
resolved.  There are still some intermittent problems reported by
some users though, and we're tracking those down.

* 2) SSU status

Most of my time is spent focused on the 0.6 UDP code, and no, its
not ready for release, and yes, there is progress ;)  Right now it
can handle multiple networks, keeping some peers on UDP and others
on TCP with fairly reasonable performance.  The hard part is working
through all the congestion/contention cases, since the live net will
be under constant load, but there's been a lot of progress there in
the last day or so.  More news when there's more news.

* 3) Unit test bounty

As duck mentioned on the list [1], zab has seeded a bounty to help
out I2P with a series of testing updates - some funds for anyone who
can complete the tasks listed on the bounty page [2].  We've had
some further donations to that bounty [3] - it currently stands at
$1000USD.  While the bounties certainly don't offer &quot;market rate&quot;,
they are a small token of encouragement for developers who want to
help out.

* 4) ???

Ok, I'm late for the meeting again... I should probably sign and
send this out, 'eh?  Swing on by the meeting and we can discuss
other issues as well.

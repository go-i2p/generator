Hi y'all, time for our weekly pre-meeting status update

* Index
1) Net status
2) I2PSnark updates
3) Syndie blog UI
4) ???

* 1) Net status

There haven't been many changes in the past week regarding network
status, since no major updates have been rolled out.  Some people
are still experiencing an increase in irc disconnects (with sessions
lasting only a few hours) while others are having multiday sessions.
It has almost been three weeks since the last release though, and
zzz's tunnel creation updates seem to be helping out, so we'll
probably have a new release out in the next few days.  That release
will probably not yet include changes based on the lessons being
learnt from the ongoing load testing, however (since I don't want to
hold up the release too long).

2) I2PSnark updates

In the past week, I've added in multitorrent support to snark and
strapped a simple web interface on top of it.  Reports from beta
testers are fairly positive, but there is still some debugging left
to be done, since snark wasn't originally designed to continue
running after a particular torrent was stopped (and, in turn, relied
upon the JVM to shut down, releasing held resources).  Its also
fairly memory intensive when actively participating in swarms
(holding pieces in memory rather than keeping data entirely on disk,
etc).  This means heavy I2PSnark users will likely want to increase
their JVM's maximum heap size, or alternately, use a standalone JVM
for their I2PSnark usage.

There's a standalone I2PSnark build in CVS right now - pull the
latest and run:
  ant i2psnark
  cp i2psnark-standalone.zip /some/directory
  cd /some/directory ; unzip i2psnark-standalone.zip ; cd i2psnark
  java -jar launch-i2psnark.jar &amp; 
  lynx <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://localhost:8002/">http://localhost:8002/</a>

I'll bundle the necessary scripts in with the new release to
automate that as well, so users with normal I2P installs can just
run I2PSnark standalone with as little hassle as possible.

3) Syndie blog UI

As mentioned last week, there have been some improvements to the 
Syndie blog UI in the latest CVS.  There's a new page that offers
two different summaries of users - a list of your favorite blogs,
and a separate list of other blogs, both ordered by last update
date.  The favorites list is essentially a way to view blogs
through a whitelist (only listing authors marked with the smiley
face), while the &quot;other blogs&quot; list is a way to view them through a
blacklist (avoiding authors marked with that frown face).  Both
lists simply go to a slightly modified threaded view, except it
displays multiple posts at once, and only includes threads started
by the selected author (not threads they merely participated in).

4) ???

There is lots going on at the app level as well as in the router
core, and there has been some interesting discussions on the forum
in the past week.  In any case, if anyone wants to bring anything up
during our meeting, swing on by in a few minutes and say hi!

* 1) Net status and load testing

Not much has changed in the last week, though we have had a little
trouble on the irc servers.  Most of my time has been spent on
various network load tests, trying to track down the source of our
current throughput bottleneck.  Tunnels themselves can transfer at
a high rate.  SSU can transfer at an even higher rate.  And the
streaming lib can push even more data than that.  There are two
general possibilities for the bottleneck - some software bug, or
suboptimal (aka bad) peer selection.  What I'm doing now is trying
to determine which it is.  Preliminary indications are that some
peers (perhaps 25%) have no trouble pushing 20-100KBps through a
tunnel, while the rest stay in the 1-4KBps range under load.
However, thats only very preliminary results, and more realistic
load tests are ongoing.

We've also got zzz's latest changes improving the tunnel creation in
CVS, and reports from the field have been good - nice work zzz!  I'm
not sure when 0.6.1.8 will come out, but if not by the weekend, then
early next week.  We'll see.

* 2) I2PSnark

The other day while gathering data from some load tests I patched up
I2PSnark so that it can deal with torrents created by Azureus and
I2PRufus again.  The problem was that it didn't know how to deal
with some of the newer torrent attributes (&quot;name.utf-8&quot; and
&quot;path.utf-8&quot;), which was causing it to mess up the infohash (and
hence be unable to talk to the tracker or any peers).  Thats fixed
in CVS, so it should be a workable anonymous bt client again - if
anyone has problems getting it to deal with a torrent that I2P-BT
can deal with, please let me know.

* 3) Syndie

Polecat has been hacking away, with the latest addition offering
thumbnail support for attachments in SML (see the smlref.jsp on the
current CVS build for more details).  I also put together a first 
pass at the blog interface, but its not really that great, so
another pass is definitely in the offing.  Keep an eye on your
Syndie instance for the latest Syndie news, of course.

* 4) ???

There's lots going on, as always, though my focus still continues to
be on improving performance to the point where its adequate for
reasonable uses.  As mentioned on the forum, that I2Phex sourceforge
fiasco is finally taken care of, and discussion continues regarding
jbigi and jcpuid builds and dependencies (more news on that front
when there's more to say).  Anyway, as always swing on by the
meeting tonight at 20:00 UTC and say hey!

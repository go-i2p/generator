Hi y'all, another quick update this week

* Index
1) Net status
2) ???

* 1) Net status

The past week has been reasonably stable on the net - we've got more
than 60 routers with more than 3 days uptime (a few with 2+ week
uptimes), and I've had an irc connection for more than three days
now.  There have been some tweaks in tunnel throttling the last
week, but not too many, as I've had some changes on an inaccessible
machine.

Speaking of which, though, betty is back online as of a few hours
ago, and my outstanding changes have been batched together, with
testing going on at the moment.  That means we'll probably have a
new release later this week, pushing out all the changes since
0.6.1.12-0.  More news when there's more news, as always.

* 2) ???

This past week has been pretty slow on the development front, due to
hardware issues, but there have been some interesting things going
on at the app level.  Rather than steal their thunder, though, I'll
just keep my mouth shut until those hacking on things are ready to
discuss 'em publicly.  Anyway, as I'm already late for the meeting,
I should probably wrap up these notes - see you in #i2p!

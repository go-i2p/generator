* 1) Net status

The past week has been pretty stable, with no new release yet.  I've
been churning away on tunnel throttling and low bandwidth operation,
but to help out with that testing, I've integrated JRobin with the
web console and our stats management system.

* 2) JRobin

JRobin [1] is a pure java port of RRDtool [2], which lets us generate
pretty graphs like the ones zzz has been churning out with very
little memory overhead.  We've got it configured to work entirely
in-memory, so there's no file lock contention, and the time to update
the database is imperceptable.  There are a whole lot of neat things
that JRobin can do that we aren't exploiting, but the next release
will have the basic functionality, plus a means to export the data
in a format RRDtool can understand.

* 3) biff and toopie

Postman has been hacking away on some useful bots, and I'm glad to
report that the lovable biff is back [3], letting you know whenever
you've got (anonymous) mail while sitting on irc2p.  In addition,
postman has built up a whole new bot for us - toopie - to serve as an
info bot for I2P/irc2p.  We're still feeding toopie FAQs, but he'll
be coming into the usual channels shortly.  Thanks postman!

* 4) new key

For those paying attention, you'll have noticed that my gpg key is
expiring in a few days.  My new key @ <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dev.i2p.net/~jrandom">http://dev.i2p.net/~jrandom</a> has
the fingerprint 0209 9706 442E C4A9 91FA  B765 CE08 BC25 33DC 8D49
and key id 33DC8D49.  This post is signed by my old key, but my
subsequent posts (and releases) for the next year will be signed by
the new key.

* 5) ???

Thats about it for the moment - swing on by #i2p in a few minutes for
our weekly meeting to say hey!

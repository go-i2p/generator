Hi y'all, brief status notes this week

* Index
1) 0.6.1.26 and network status
2) Syndie development status
3) Distributed version control revisited
4) ???

* 1) 0.6.1.26 and network status

The other day we pushed out a new 0.6.1.26 release, including lots
of i2psnark improvements from zzz and some new NTP safety checks
from Complication, and reports have been positive.  The network
seems to be growing slightly with no new odd effects, though some
people still have trouble building their tunnels (as has always
been the case).

* 2) Syndie development status

More and more improvements have been coming down the line, with
the current alpha version sitting at 0.910a.  The feature list
for 1.0 is pretty much met, so right now its largely bugfixing
and documentation.  Swing on by #i2p if you want to help test :)

Also, there have been some discussions on the channel for designs
of the Syndie GUI - meerboop has come up with some cool ideas, and
is working on docing them up.  The Syndie GUI is the main component
of the Syndie 2.0 release, so the sooner we get that rolling, the
sooner we take over the worl^W^W^W^W can push Syndie out on the
unsuspecting masses.

There's also a new proposal in my Syndie blog regarding bug and
feature request tracking using Syndie itself.  For ease of access,
I've made a plain text export of that post up on the web - page 1
is at <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dev.i2p.net/~jrandom/bugsp1.txt">http://dev.i2p.net/~jrandom/bugsp1.txt</a> and page 2 is at
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://dev.i2p.net/~jrandom/bugsp2.txt">http://dev.i2p.net/~jrandom/bugsp2.txt</a>

* 3) Distributed version control revisited

One of the things still to be sorted out for Syndie is the public
revision control system to use, and as mentioned before, distributed
and offline functionality is necessary.  I've been going through the
half dozen or so open source ones out there (darcs, mercurial, 
git/cogito, monotone, arch, bzr, codeville), digging through their
docs, trying them out, and talking with their devs.  Right now,
monotone and bzr seem to be the best in terms of functionality and
safety (with untrusted repositories, we need strong crypto to make
sure we are only pulling authentic changes), and monotone's tight
crypto integration seems very appealing.  Still working through the
several hundred pages of docs though, but from what I've discussed
with the monotone devs, they seem to be doing everything Right.

Of course, no matter what dvcs we end up going with, all releases
will be made available in plain tarball format, and patches will
be accepted for review in plain diff -uw format.  But still, for
those who might consider getting involved in the development, I'd
love to hear your thoughts and preferences.

* 4) ???

As you can see, lots going on, as always.  There's been further
discussion on that &quot;solve world hunger&quot; thread on the forum, too,
so check it out at <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://forum.i2p.net/viewtopic.php?t=1910">http://forum.i2p.net/viewtopic.php?t=1910</a>

If you've got something further to discuss, please swing on by #i2p
for our dev meeting tonight, or post up to the forum or list!

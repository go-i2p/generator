Hi gang, 'tis time for our pre-wednesday meeting

* Index
1) Net status and 0.6.1.17
2) I2Phex
3) ???

* 1) Net status and 0.6.1.17

After a few days of monitoring some patches, we pushed out a new
0.6.1.17 release, and so far, the improvement has been substantial.
Tunnel build success rates have increased by one to two orders of
magnitude, and throttled peers are now able to operate with
reasonable bandwidth constraints again.  A good 60%+ of the network
has upgraded so far (thanks!), though getting the rest up to speed
would be useful.

There's still work to be done to improve the situation - live
tunnel testing, throughput, and peer selection needs work - but it
looks like we're back on track.

* 2) I2Phex

Word on the street is that Complication is hacking up some fixes for
a few longstanding I2Phex bugs, with some already committed to cvs.
I've seen some posts on the forum from an unspecified nym regarding
some future modifications too, and while I have no idea whats going
on there, I look forward to any patch submissions.  We'll push out
a new I2Phex release whenever there are substantial changes to be
used, of course.

* 3) ???

Thats about it for the moment, so please swing on by #i2p for our
weekly meeting in a few minutes!

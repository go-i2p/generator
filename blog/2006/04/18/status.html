Hi y'all, tuesday rolls around again for our weekly status notes

* Index
1) Net status and 0.6.1.16
2) Tunnel creation and congestion
3) Feedspace
4) ???

* 1) Net status and 0.6.1.16

With 70% of the network upgraded to 0.6.1.16, we seem to be seeing
an improvement over earlier releases, and with the issues fixed in
that release out of the way, we've got a clearer view of our next
bottleneck.  For those not yet on 0.6.1.16, please upgrade as soon
as possible, since earlier releases will reject tunnel creation
requests arbitrarily (even if the router has sufficient resources to
participate in more tunnels).

* 2) Tunnel creation and congestion

Right now, it seems we are experiencing what is probably best
described as congestion collapse - tunnel creation requests are
being rejected because routers are low on bandwidth, so more tunnel
creation requests are sent out in hopes of finding other routers
with spare resources, only to increase the bandwidth used.  This
issue has been around since we switched to the new tunnel creation
crypto in 0.6.1.10 and can substantially be tied to the fact that we
don't get per-hop join/reject feedback until (or more to the point,
*unless*) the request and reply has traversed the length of two
tunnels.  If any of those peers fail to pass the message along, we
don't know which peer failed, which peers agreed, and which peers
explicitly rejected it.

We already limit the number of concurrent tunnel creation requests
in flight (and tests are showing increasing the timeout doesn't
help), so Nagle's traditional solution isn't sufficient.  I'm trying
out a few tweaks to our request processing code now, to cut down on
the frequency of silent request drops (as opposed to explicit
rejections), and on our request generation code to cut down on the
concurrency under load.  I'm also trying out some other improvements
that are getting substantially increased tunnel build success rates,
though those aren't yet ready for safe usage.

There's light down the tunnel, and I appreciate your patience
sticking with us as we move forward.  I expect we'll have another
release later this week to push out some of the improvements, after
which point we'll reevaluate the state of the net to see whether the
congestion collapse is addressed.

* 3) Feedspace

Frosk has been churning away on Feedspace, and has updated a few
pages up on the trac site, including a new overview doc, a set of
outstanding tasks, some db details, and more.  Swing on by 
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://feedspace.i2p/">http://feedspace.i2p/</a> to catch up on the latest changes, and perhaps
pelt Frosk with questions at your earliest convenience :)

* 4) ???

Thats about all I'm ready to discuss at the moment, but please swing
on by #i2p for our meeting later this evening (8pm UTC) to chat some
more!

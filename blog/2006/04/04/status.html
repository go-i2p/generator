Hi y'all, tuesday rolls 'round again

* Index
1) Net status and 0.6.1.14
2) Syndie plotting
3) Local jbigi optimizations
4) ???

* 1) Net status and 0.6.1.14

The 0.6.1.13 release is still a bit bumpy out there, though we've
had some substantial fixes and improvements in subsequent builds.
I hope to have a new 0.6.1.14 release out in the next few days,
so keep your ears to the ground!

* 2) Syndie plotting

There've been a bunch of discussions regarding syndie revamps,
including GUIs, browser plugins, full text search, a more complete
syndication scheduler, an archive manager, multipage posts, support
for more formatting options, and a whole bunch more.  I expect we'll
be getting way on a substantial set of mods pretty soon, so if you
want to get involved, or get your ideas implemented, speak up :)

* 3) Local jbigi optimizations

There have been reports of even further jbigi optimization for amd64
users, and while jbigi probably isn't near the choke point for those
with such machines, the reduced cpu load may help.  There's a thread
describing build instructions on the forum, though I'm having
trouble reaching it at the moment.

* 4) ???

As always, if there's something you want to discuss, swing by our
weekly dev meeting (in -1 minutes [oops!]) and say hey!

<pre>Hi y'all, time for a brief set of notes before tonight's meeting.
I realize that you may have a variety of questions or issues to
bring up, so we'll go in a more fluid format than usual.  There
are just a few things I want to mention first.

* Network status

It seems the network is doing pretty well, with swarms of fairly
large I2PSnark transfers completing, and with quite sustantial
transfer rates achieved on individual routers - I've seen
650KBytes/sec and 17,000 participating tunnels without any
fireworks.  Routers on the low end of the spectrum seem to be
doing fine too, browsing eepsites(I2P Sites) and irc with 2 hop tunnels
using under 1KByte/sec average.

It isn't all roses for everyone though, but we're working through
updating the router's behavior so as to allow more consistent and
usable performance.

* NTCP

The new NTCP transport (&quot;new&quot; tcp) is doing quite well after
clearing up the initial bumps and bruises.  To answer a frequent
question, in the long run, both NTCP and SSU will be in operation -
we are not reverting to TCP-only.

* eepsite(I2P Site) reachability

Remember folks that eepsites(I2P Sites) are reachable only when the person
who is running it has it up - if they're down, there's nothing
you can do to reach it ;)  Unfortunately, for the past few days,
orion.i2p hasn't been reachable, but the net is definitely still
working - perhaps swing by inproxy.tino.i2p or eepsites(I2P Sites).i2p for
your network survey needs.

Anyway, there's lots more going on, but it'd be a bit premature
to mention it here.  Of course, if you have any questions or
concerns, swing on by #i2p in a few minutes for our *cough* weekly
development meeting.

Thanks for your help moving us forward!

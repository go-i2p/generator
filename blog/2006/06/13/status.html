<pre>Hi gang, 'tis tuesday again,

* Index
1) Net status
2) 0.6.1.21
3) ???

* 1) Net status

These days, things aren't doing so great on the net, and
unfortunately, there aren't local tweaks you can do to improve it.
Your patience is appreciated.

* 2) 0.6.1.21

Over the last few releases, we've been trimming down variables in
the network's behavior, and in the next day or so we should have a
new 0.6.1.21 release to build upon the experiences we've found with
0.6.1.20.  Among other things, tomorrow's release should reduce the
number of unnecessary tunnel rejections (though to a state thats a
bit too free-wheeling), and as that is deployed, we'll hopefully
see some improvement.  If not, we've still got one more subsystem
to shred to get us back into good form, but I'd like to avoid that
battle, if at all possible.

* 3) ???

That's about it for the moment - swing on by #i2p in a few minutes
for our meeting to say hey!

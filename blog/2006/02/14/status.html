Hi y'all, quick update today

* Index
1) Net status
2) 0.6.1.10
3) Syndie activity
4) ???

* 1) Net status

As I said last week, &quot;There haven't been any substantial changes on
the live net over the last week, so the live net status hasn't changed
much.  On the other hand...&quot;

* 2) 0.6.1.10

There has been more progress with the _PRE network to get us to
the 0.6.1.10 release, and the other day I gave y'all the 5 day
warning [1].  Things are still on track, so I expect 0.6.1.10 to be
out sometime late thursday.  The release will not be backwards
compatible, and your router will likely create a new router identity
and require reseeding to get onto the new network.  This should
happen transparently though.

One word of warning for users of CVS though - after tonight's
meeting, I'll begin merging back the _PRE branch into the trunk, so
stay clear of CVS until 0.6.1.10 is released.

* 3) Syndie activity

There's been an increase in traffic on Syndie lately, which is quite
cool, so swing by your local instance [2] or a public node [3] to
see whats up.

* 4) ???

Thats about it for the moment, swing on by the meeting in a few
minutes and say hey!

* 1) Net status

The network has been having a bit of rough weather with the 0.6.1.10
release, due in part to the backwards incompatibility, but also due
to unexpected bugs.  Neither reliability nor uptime on 0.6.1.10
was sufficient, so over the last 5 days there was been a flurry of
patches, culminating in the new 0.6.1.11 release -

Most of the bugs found in 0.6.1.10 have been present since the 0.6
release last September, but weren't readily apparent while there
were alternate transports to fall back on (TCP).  My local test
network simulates packet failure, but didn't really cover router
churn and other persistent network failures.  The _PRE test network
also included a self-selected set of fairly reliable peers, too, so
there were substantial situations not fully explored prior to the
full release.  Thats a problem, obviously, and next time we'll make
sure to include a wider selection of scenarios.

There's a bunch of things going on at the moment, but the new
0.6.1.11 release jumped to the head of the queue.  The network will
continue to be a bit bumpy until a large number of people are up to
date, after which work will continue moving forward.  One thing
worth mentioning is that cervantes is working through some sort of
IE-related security domain exploit, and while I'm not sure if he is
ready to explain the details, preliminary results suggest its
viable, so the anonymity-minded out there should avoid IE in the 
meantime (but you knew that anyway ;).  Perhaps cervantes can give
us a summary in the meeting?

Anyway, thats all I've got to mention at the moment - swing on by
the meeting in a few minutes to say hey!

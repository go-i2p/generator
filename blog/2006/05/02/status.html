Hi y'all, tuesday rolls 'round one more time

* Index
1) Net status
2) Syndie status
3) ???

* 1) Net status

With another week on 0.6.1.17 under our belt, several of the prime
measurements of network health are staying in good shape.  We are
however seeing some of the remaining problems propogate up to the
application layer, namely the recent rise in reconnections on the
irc2p servers.  Postman, cervantes, Complication, and myself have
been digging through various aspects of the network's behavior as it
relates to the user-visible performance, and we've tracked down and
implemented a few improvements (current CVS HEAD is 0.6.1.17-4).
We're still monitoring its behavior and experimenting with some
tweaks before pushing it out as 0.6.1.18 though, but thats probably
only a few days away.

* 2) Syndie status

As mentioned before, syndie is being massively revamped.  When I say
massively, I mean nearly completely redesigned and reimplemented ;)
The framework is in place (including continual testing with gcj),
and the first few pieces are coming together, but its still a while
away from functional.  Once its in a position where more hands can
help move it forward (and, erm, *use it*), there'll be more
information available, but right now the syndie revamp is basically
the back burner item while working through the router improvements.

* 3) ???

Thats about it to report at the moment - as always, if you've got
something to bring up, swing on by the meeting in a few minutes and
say hey!

Hey y'all, quick meta-notes today.  I've got to bolt for the evening
and won't be back in time for the meeting, but will write up a set of
status notes tomorrow (with the meeting next week, of course).
Complication has been churning away with some neat mods in cvs, and
there is some promising stuff coming up, so hopefully we'll have a
release later this week.  Not sure though.

In any case, if y'all meet up tonight, please keep logs of the
meeting and commit 'em to the i2pwww cvs module and I'll post those to
the site tomorrow.

Anyway, ttyl

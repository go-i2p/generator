<pre>Hi y'all, after a brief intermission, its time for our weekly status
notes again (unsigned for system maintenance reasons)

* Index
1) Net status
2) Peer filtering
3) Syndie status
4) ???

* 1) Net status

Unfortunately, there isn't anything new to report regarding the
network's status.  The seas are still pretty rough out there, and
as far as I can see, there's no tweak or tunable parameter you can
use to safely improve it locally.  We'll put out more information
and releases to do so when its available, but in the meantime, your
patience is appreciated.

* 2) Peer filtering

One modification I've been working through for a while is a more
aggressive filter on what routers we use to pick peers for our
tunnels.  I've been planning on deploying it after things settle
down a bit and with some further safety measures, but as it may in
fact alleviate our current problems, I think we can go ahead and try
it out as a proof of concept.  If it performs as hoped, we'll rev it
up with some (unfortunately disruptive) safety measures, but if it
doesn't, there's no need to go through the disruption.

I'm hoping to get a release out this week, though it may have to
wait until the weekend.

* 3) Syndie status

There has been some progress on the revamp, though its been slow
going.  More news when there's more news.

* 4) ???

Thats about all I have to bring up at the moment - if anyone has
anything they'd like to discuss, please swing on by #i2p tonight at
8PM UTC!

I2P release 0.7.2
=====================

The 0.7.2 release fixes multiple bugs and potential problems
in I2P, while preparing ground for new functionality.

Threading issues with the SimpleTimer class should no longer occur,
the NTCP transport should no longer encounter null pointer exceptions,
and "abandoned" tunnels should finish operation correctly.

Support is added for accessing the Router Console over IPv6,
a new message type enables I2CP applications to query
the router's bandwidth limits, an experimental desktop interface
for managing the router is included for the first time
(but not enabled automatically yet) and participation of a single peer
in too many tunnels is prevented to improve reliability and safety.

Besides other maintenance work, several old statistics calculators
are dropped to make router profiles smaller and quicker, while
new build scripts are supplied for I2P's big integer math library.
Updating is highly recommended.

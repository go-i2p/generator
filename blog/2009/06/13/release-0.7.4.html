I2P release 0.7.4
=====================

I2P version 0.7.4 introduces notable new features
like GeoIP capability and UPnP support. While the former
can become a basis for geographically aware tunnel-building,
the latter should immediately enable more routers to accept
inbound TCP connections, helping distribute workload more evenly.

Inbound NTCP is now enabled automaticaly if the router
does not appear firewalled, and default bandwidth limits
for new installations are increased.

In addition, multiple bugfixes and updates are included,
addressing issues with the NTCP transport, BOB protocol,
connection limiting, behaviour of new I2PTunnel options
and the SusiDNS user interface. Improvements to the Router Console
are likewise included. Updating is recommended.

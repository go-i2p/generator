<p>
I2P version 0.7.7 contains several anonymity improvements.
The use of session keys for crypto was completely reworked,
and I2PSnark now uses its own tunnels for tracker communication.
Work continues on improving the router console,
including conformance to HTML standards and better support of UTF-8.
</p><p>
Work also continues on increasing speeds, both by reducing the
number of session keys transferred, by improving the
methods of dropping messages during overload, and by reducing
drops by high-bandwidth routers.
There is a new unsigned update option
for those of you that would like automatic updates to bleeding-edge development versions.
</p><p>
The release also contains several changes to reduce memory and CPU usage,
and a large assortment of bug fixes.
Upgrading is recommended.

I2P release 0.7.3
=====================

I2P version 0.7.3 contains several buxfixes and improvements,
includes a lot of maintenance work and new versions of
both the SAM and BOB application gateway protocols.

A patch to I2P's internal web server Jetty is included
to correct SusiDNS behaviour on Windows. The way I2P nodes
volunteer to participate in the Network Database is changed
to avoid too many doing this simultaneously, and creation
of new participating tunnels is now throttled before messages
in existing tunnels start to get dropped.

Multiple improvements to the Router Console and other components
are included, I2PSnark can handle bigger torrents and more files,
while work continues on the experimental desktop interface.
Updating is recommended.

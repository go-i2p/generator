I2P release 0.7.1
=====================

The 0.7.1 release optimizes I2P towards better performance
and introduces new features.

Multiple bugs are fixed, replacements to the SimpleTimer class
should waste less time on object locking. Some old components
are dropped and several classes refactored to avoid repeating code.

Support for encrypted LeaseSets (for creation of links over I2P
which an adversary cannot obstruct by attacking its gateways)
becomes more complete. New tunnel types like IRC server tunnels
and new options like delayed start and idling of tunnels
also gain support, along with improved usability of the I2P
Socks proxy mechanism.

Work continues on streamlining and expanding the Router Console,
on the BOB protocol, on I2P ports for Debian and Slackware Linux,
on the I2PSnark client, on TCP connection properties
and multiple other fronts. Updating is highly recommended.

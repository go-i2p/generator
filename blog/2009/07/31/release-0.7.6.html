<p>
I2P version 0.7.6 contains additional fixes for network stability issues
related to tunnel building and connection limits.
While the 0.7.5 release greatly improved the congestion that
appeared UTC evenings and weekends, it was not eliminated;
this release should improve the situation further.
</p><p>
This version also has new console themes by dr|z3d,
which may be selected on the new UI configuration page.
Sorry, the new themes are not available for IE browsers.
</p><p>
The default tunnel length variance is changed from 1 to 0.
This mainly affects exploratory tunnels and iMule.
<a href="http://zzz.i2p/topics/260">As explained on zzz.i2p</a>,
a non-zero variance adds very little protection, at great cost
in resources.
Should you wish to reconfigure your exploratory settings back to the old variance of 1,
or change to length 3 variance 0,
you may do so on the config tunnels page.
iMule settings are best changed within that application.
</p><p>
I2P now stores temporary data in the system temp directory
(generally /var/tmp on Linux and %TEMP% on Windows).
For new installs only,
user data is in $HOME/.i2p on Linux/Mac and
%APPDATA%\I2P on Windows.
</p><p>
The release contains several changes to reduce resource usage
(memory, CPU, and connections) and the usual assortment of bug fixes.
Upgrading is recommended.
</p><p>
This is the first release built and signed by zzz.
Thanks again to Complication for his many contributions to the project
over the past five years.
I2P is undergoing the most rapid development in years. Please give the
developers feedback on IRC #i2p or <a href="http://forum.i2p2.de">forum.i2p2.de</a>
and <a href="http://www.i2p2.de/getinvolved.html">get involved</a>!

Release details:
<p>
Connection Limits and related congestion
<ul>
<li>Split the limiting actions into three thresholds (75%, 81%, and 87%) instead of all happening at 80%, for better control, and to save the drastic actions for the higher thresholds.
<li>Other minor changes, perhaps temporary, to improve tunnel build success.
<li>Change default tunnel length variance to zero, to help iMule and exploratory build success. As explained elsewhere on this site, this will have a negligible affect on anonymity. Should you wish to keep a variance of 1 for a particular tunnel pool, change it back on configtunnels.jsp or in i2ptunnel, or the iMule config.
<li>Make shared clients tunnels reduce-on-idle for new installs.
</ul>

Resources
<ul>
<li>Expire peer profiles quicker and display less, to reduce memory use.
<li>Use StringBuilder throughout, faster than StringBuffer
<li>Reduce stats coalesce frequency, this is a big CPU user
<li>Allocate much less memory on first startup
<li>Remove more unused classes
</ul>

Transport

<ul>
<li>More fixes related to UPnP, recognition of firewalls and changing firewall conditions, and address changes.
</ul>

Browser Launcher

<ul>
<li>Wait until the console is up before launching browser.
</ul>

Console and Themes

<ul>
<li>New console, i2psnark, susimail, susidns, and proxy error page themes by dr|zed
<li>Console themes are selectable on configui.jsp.
<li>Console themes not available for IE users.
<li>Fixes for Opera
</ul>

Proxy

<ul>
<li>Serve css and image files at the reserved proxy.i2p address, to better display the error pages when the user is on a different machine.
</ul>

Installer, Split Directories, Distro-Friendly Organization

<ul>
<li>For new installs, code and data will be split into different directories. Data (router files, config files, i2psnark files, eepsite(I2P Site) files, etc.) will be in ~/.i2p on linux and %APPDATA%\I2P on Windows. The code directory can be read-only to the user (although the user will not be able to update in that case). On linux, the shell scripts i2prouter, runplain.sh, and eepget can be moved to a directory such as /usr/bin. All assumptions that files are in the current working directory are removed. Don't launch the router anymore in the install scripts on linux.
<li>For existing installs, about the only visible change will be a few temporary files now in the Java temporary directory (e.g. /var/tmp on linux) instead of $I2P.
</ul>

Reseeder

<ul>
<li>Move the reseeder from the routerconsole to the router, for easier embedding of the router in other code (e.g. android, iMule)
</ul>

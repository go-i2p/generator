{% trans -%} 2.8.1 fixes accesses to local sites that were broken in
2.8.0. We have added notification bubbles to several applications in the
console to highlight application messages. We fixed a tunnel test bug
that may have been affecting tunnel reliability. The addressbook now has
a new \"latest\" tab that displays the newest hostnames added from your
subscriptions. There are several dark theme fixes and improvements. {%-
endtrans %}

{% trans -%} We fixed the installer that previously failed on Java 21 or
higher. We also fixed installing to directory paths that contain spaces
on Linux. For those of you that use Docker, we updated outdated Docker
container and container libraries. {%- endtrans %}

{% trans -%} As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The
best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest
release. {%- endtrans %}

<p>
0.7.9 fixes several longstanding bugs causing message corruption.
We are hopeful that network performance will improve once it is widely deployed.
There are other changes that should help router reachability and tunnel build success rates.
The release also includes additional translation support, and a full Russian translation by "forget"
which was sponsored by "russiansponsor".
</p><p>
There are more changes to reduce memory and CPU usage,
and other bug fixes.
Upgrading is recommended.
Please give the
developers feedback on IRC #i2p or <a href="http://forum.i2p2.de/">forum.i2p2.de</a>
and <a href="http://www.i2p2.de/getinvolved.html">get involved</a>
or <a href="http://www.i2p2.de/donate.html">donate</a>!
We are still looking for help on new and existing translations.
Please volunteer on IRC #i2p.

Release details:

<p><strong>Transport and Tunnels</strong></p>

<p>- Fix three bugs, each several years old, causing corrupted tunnel messages. The fixes will hopefully improve network speed.
<br />- Fix a bug preventing firewalled routers from finding introducers. This fix should help network connectivity.
<br />- Improve the algorithm for dropping messages when overloaded at the inbound gateway.
<br />- Fix the error messages on the console when the computer is completely disconnected from the network.
<br />- Fix the way excessive clock skew is calculated and reported.
<br />- Increase the tunnel build timeout, which will improve build success rate.
<br />- Prioritize tunnel builds so pools that most need tunnels build first
<br />- New experimental &quot;laptop mode&quot; for enhanced anonymity when changing locations</p>

<p><strong>Router Console Translation Support</strong></p>

<p>- New Russian translation by &quot;forget&quot; with support from &quot;russiansponsor&quot;
<br />- Translation support added for i2psnark, i2ptunnel, and susidns.
<br />- Several updates to translations.
<br />- We are searching for additional translation volunteers.</p>

<p><strong>I2CP</strong></p>

<p>- Where possible, keep client-router communications within the JVM rather than going through an external socket, for performance.</p>

<p><strong>HTTP Proxy</strong></p>

<p>- Where possible, keep client-proxy communications within the JVM rather than going through an external socket, for performance.
<br />- Allow configuration of the jump server list</p>

<p><strong>Other</strong></p>

<p>- Reduce startup time by 10-15s
<br />- Continued improvements to reduce package size and memory usage
<br />- Continued console improvements</p>

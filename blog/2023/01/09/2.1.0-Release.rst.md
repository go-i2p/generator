{% trans -%} Update details {%- endtrans %}
============================================

{% trans -%} We have learned several things since our 2.0.0 release in
November. As routers have updated to that release, the network has gone
from about 1% to over 60% support for our new SSU2 transport protocol.
First, we have confirmed that SSU2 is a solid, well designed, and secure
protocol. Second, however, we have found and fixed numerous minor or
rarely-triggered bugs in the implementation of the protocol.
Cumulatively, the effects of these bugs have reduced the performance of
the network. {%- endtrans %}

{% trans -%} Also, we are aware of increased tunnel count and reduced
tunnel build success rate in the network, possibly triggered by
Bitcoin\'s new I2P transient address feature, but made worse by our SSU2
bugs and other congestion control problems. We are working with Bitcoin
and other non-Bitcoin projects to reduce I2P network demands. We have
improved our algorithms to reduce network load during times of
congestion. We are also collaborating with i2pd to develop common
congestion control strategies. {%- endtrans %}

{% trans -%} Therefore, we have accelerated this release by about six
weeks, to get the fixes out to everybody. i2pd released their version
2.45.0 last week and the early results are encouraging. New protocols,
and distributed networks, are difficult to develop. Congestion can
arrive with little warning and with little clue of the cause. Thank you
for your patience as we have diagnosed and hopefully fixed the problems.

{% trans -%} As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The
best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest
release. {%- endtrans %}

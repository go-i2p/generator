# What is I2P?

- The Invisible Internet Project (I2P) is a fully encrypted private
 network layer. It protects your activity and location. Every day
 people use the network to connect with people without worry of being
 tracked or their data being collected. In some cases people rely on
 the network when they need to be discrete or are doing sensitive
 work.

# I2P Cares About Privacy

- I2P hides the server from the user and the user from the server. All
 I2P traffic is internal to the I2P network. Traffic inside I2P does
 not interact with the Internet directly. It is a layer on top of the
 Internet. It uses encrypted unidirectional tunnels between you and
 your peers. No one can see where traffic is coming from, where it is
 going, or what the contents are. Additionally I2P offers resistance
 to pattern recognition and blocking by censors. Because the network
 relies on peers to route traffic, location blocking is also
 reduced.

# Peer-to-Peer

The network is people powered . Peers make a portion of their resources,
particularly bandwidth, available to other network participants. This
allows the network to function without relying on centralized servers.

# Privacy and Security By Design

I2P has created transport protocols that resist DPI censorship, and
continuously improves its end to end encryption. [Read the I2P Transport
Overview]().

# Built For Communication

I2P has an application layer with easy to use[APIs for creating your own
privacy - aware apps.]()

 I2P Specification
Documents 

This page provides the specifications for various components of the I2P
network and router software. These are living documents, and the
specifications are updated as modifications are made to the network and
software. The proposal documents that track changes to these
specifications can be viewed
[here]().

- \"Last updated\" is the last date when the specification given
 within a document was altered in any way, except for changes to the
 \"accurate for\" information.
- The \"accurate for\" column gives the API version of the I2P network
 and reference Java implementation that the document is verified to
 be valid for. Because the documents are usually only updated when
 changes are made, the listed versions can sometimes be several
 releases behind. This does not mean that documents with old listed
 versions are necessarily inaccurate, but small differences may creep
 in during the course of development. Periodic reviews are conducted
 to update the \"accurate for\" information.

The I2P Project is committed to maintaining accurate, current
documentation. If you find any inaccuracies in the documents linked
below, please [enter a ticket identifying the
problem]().

 Index to Technical
Documentation 2022-08
0.9.55 

Following is an index to the technical documentation for I2P.

This index is ordered from the highest to lowest layers. The higher
layers are for \"clients\" or applications; the lower layers are inside
the router itself. The interface between applications and the router is
the I2CP (I2P Control Protocol) API.

The specifications linked below are currently supported in the network.
See the [Proposals]() page
for specifications in discussion or development.

The I2P Project is committed to maintaining accurate, current
documentation. If you find any inaccuracies in the documents linked
below, please [enter a ticket identifying the
problem]().

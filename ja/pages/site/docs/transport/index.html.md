## Transports in I2P

A \"transport\" in I2P is a method for direct, point-to-point
communication between two routers. Transports must provide
confidentiality and integrity against external adversaries while
authenticating that the router contacted is the one who should receive a
given message.

I2P supports multiple transports simultaneously. There are three
transports currently implemented:

Each provides a \"connection\" paradigm, with authentication, flow
control, acknowledgments and retransmission.

## Transport Services

The transport subsystem in I2P provides the following services:

- Reliable delivery of [I2NP]() messages.
 Transports support I2NP message delivery ONLY. They are not
 general-purpose data pipes.
- In-order delivery of messages is NOT guaranteed by all transports.
- Maintain a set of router addresses, one or more for each transport,
 that the router publishes as its global contact information (the
 RouterInfo). Each transport may connect using one of these
 addresses, which may be IPv4 or (as of version 0.9.8) IPv6.
- Selection of the best transport for each outgoing message
- Queueing of outbound messages by priority
- Bandwidth limiting, both outbound and inbound, according to router
 configuration
- Setup and teardown of transport connections
- Encryption of point-to-point communications
- Maintenance of connection limits for each transport, implementation
 of various thresholds for these limits, and communication of
 threshold status to the router so it may make operational changes
 based on the status
- Firewall port opening using UPnP (Universal Plug and Play)
- Cooperative NAT/Firewall traversal
- Local IP detection by various methods, including UPnP, inspection of
 incoming connections, and enumeration of network devices
- Coordination of firewall status and local IP, and changes to either,
 among the transports
- Communication of firewall status and local IP, and changes to
 either, to the router and the user interface
- Determination of a consensus clock, which is used to periodically
 update the router\'s clock, as a backup for NTP
- Maintenance of status for each peer, including whether it is
 connected, whether it was recently connected, and whether it was
 reachable in the last attempt
- Qualification of valid IP addresses according to a local rule set
- Honoring the automated and manual lists of banned peers maintained
 by the router, and refusing outbound and inbound connections to
 those peers

## Transport Addresses

The transport subsystem maintains a set of router addresses, each of
which lists a transport method, IP, and port. These addresses constitute
the advertised contact points, and are published by the router to the
network database. Addresses may also contain an arbitrary set of
additional options.

Each transport method may publish multiple router addresses.

Typical scenarios are:

- A router has no published addresses, so it is considered \"hidden\"
 and cannot receive incoming connections
- A router is firewalled, and therefore publishes an SSU address which
 contains a list of cooperating peers or \"introducers\" who will
 assist in NAT traversal (see [the SSU spec]()
 for details)
- A router is not firewalled or its NAT ports are open; it publishes
 both NTCP and SSU addresses containing directly-accessible IP and
 ports.

## Transport Selection

The transport system delivers [I2NP messages]()
only. The transport selected for any message is independent of the
upper-layer protocols and contents (router or client messages, whether
an external application was using TCP or UDP to connect to I2P, whether
the upper layer was using [the streaming
library]() streaming or
[datagrams](), datagrams etc.).

For each outgoing message, the transport system solicits \"bids\" from
each transport. The transport bidding the lowest (best) value wins the
bid and receives the message for delivery. A transport may refuse to
bid.

Whether a transport bids, and with what value, depend on numerous
factors:

- Configuration of transport preferences
- Whether the transport is already connected to the peer
- The number of current connections compared to various connection
 limit thresholds
- Whether recent connection attempts to the peer have failed
- The size of the message, as different transports have different size
 limits
- Whether the peer can accept incoming connections for that transport,
 as advertised in its RouterInfo
- Whether the connection would be indirect (requiring introducers) or
 direct
- The peer\'s transport preference, as advertised in its RouterInfo

In general, the bid values are selected so that two routers are only
connected by a single transport at any one time. However, this is not a
requirement.

## New Transports and Future Work

Additional transports may be developed, including:

- A TLS/SSH look-alike transport
- An \"indirect\" transport for routers that are not reachable by all
 other routers (one form of \"restricted routes\")
- Tor-compatible pluggable transports

Work continues on adjusting default connection limits for each
transport. I2P is designed as a \"mesh network\", where it is assumed
that any router can connect to any other router. This assumption may be
broken by routers that have exceeded their connection limits, and by
routers that are behind restrictive state firewalls (restricted routes).

The current connection limits are higher for SSU than for NTCP, based on
the assumption that the memory requirements for an NTCP connection are
higher than that for SSU. However, as NTCP buffers are partially in the
kernel and SSU buffers are on the Java heap, that assumption is
difficult to verify.

Analyze [Breaking and Improving Protocol
Obfuscation]() and see how transport-layer padding
may improve things.

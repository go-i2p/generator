 Streaming
Protocol 2024-09 0.9.64 

## Oversikt

The streaming library is technically part of the \"application\" layer,
as it is not a core router function. In practice, however, it provides a
vital function for almost all existing I2P applications, by providing a
TCP-like streams over I2P, and allowing existing apps to be easily
ported to I2P. The other end-to-end transport library for client
communication is the [datagram library]().

The streaming library is a layer on top of the core [I2CP
API]() that allows reliable, in-order, and
authenticated streams of messages to operate across an unreliable,
unordered, and unauthenticated message layer. Just like the TCP to IP
relationship, this streaming functionality has a whole series of
tradeoffs and optimizations available, but rather than embed that
functionality into the base I2P code, it has been factored off into its
own library both to keep the TCP-esque complexities separate and to
allow alternative optimized implementations.

In consideration of the relatively high cost of messages, the streaming
library\'s protocol for scheduling and delivering those messages has
been optimized to allow individual messages passed to contain as much
information as is available. For instance, a small HTTP transaction
proxied through the streaming library can be completed in a single round
trip - the first messages bundle a SYN, FIN, and the small HTTP request
payload, and the reply bundles the SYN, FIN, ACK, and the HTTP response
payload. While an additional ACK must be transmitted to tell the HTTP
server that the SYN/FIN/ACK has been received, the local HTTP proxy can
often deliver the full response to the browser immediately.

The streaming library bears much resemblance to an abstraction of TCP,
with its sliding windows, congestion control algorithms (both slow start
and congestion avoidance), and general packet behavior (ACK, SYN, FIN,
RST, rto calculation, etc).

The streaming library is a robust library which is optimized for
operation over I2P. It has a one-phase setup, and it contains a full
windowing implementation.

## API

The streaming library API provides a standard socket paradigm to Java
applications. The lower-level [I2CP]() API is
completely hidden, except that applications may pass [I2CP
parameters](#options) through the streaming
library, to be interpreted by I2CP.

The standard interface to the streaming lib is for the application to
use the [I2PSocketManagerFactory]() to create
an [I2PSocketManager](). The application then
asks the socket manager for an [I2PSession](),
which will cause a connection to the router via
[I2CP](). The application can then setup
connections with an [I2PSocket]() or receive
connections with an [I2PServerSocket]().

Here are the [full streaming library Javadocs]().

For a good example of usage, see the i2psnark code.

### Options and Defaults {#options}

The options and current default values are listed below. Options are
case-sensitive and may be set for the whole router, for a particular
client, or for an individual socket on a per-connection basis. Many
values are tuned for HTTP performance over typical I2P conditions. Other
applications such as peer-to-peer services are strongly encouraged to
modify as necessary, by setting the options and passing them via the
call to
[I2PSocketManagerFactory]().createManager(\_i2cpHost,
\_i2cpPort, opts). Time values are in ms.

Note that higher-layer APIs, such as [SAM](),
[BOB](), and
[I2PTunnel](), may override these defaults
with their own defaults. Also note that many options only apply to
servers listening for incoming connections.

As of release 0.9.1, most, but not all, options may be changed on an
active socket manager or session. See the javadocs for details.

## Protocol Specification

page.]()

## Implementation Details

### Oppsett

The initiator sends a packet with the SYNCHRONIZE flag set. This packet
may contain the initial data as well. The peer replies with a packet
with the SYNCHRONIZE flag set. This packet may contain the initial
response data as well.

The initiator may send additional data packets, up to the initial window
size, before receiving the SYNCHRONIZE response. These packets will also
have the send Stream ID field set to 0. Recipients must buffer packets
received on unknown streams for a short period of time, as they may
arrive out of order, in advance of the SYNCHRONIZE packet.

### MTU Selection and Negotiation

The maximum message size (also called the MTU / MRU) is negotiated to
the lower value supported by the two peers. As tunnel messages are
padded to 1KB, a poor MTU selection will lead to a large amount of
overhead. The MTU is specified by the option
i2p.streaming.maxMessageSize. The current default MTU of 1730 was chosen
to fit precisely into two 1K I2NP tunnel messages, including overhead
for the typical case. Note: This is the maximum size of the payload
only, not including the header.

Note: For ECIES connections, which have reduced overhead, the
recommended MTU is 1812. The default MTU remains 1730 for all
connections, no matter what key type is used. Clients must use the
minimum of the sent and received MTU, as usual. See proposal 155.

The first message in a connection includes a 387 byte (typical)
Destination added by the streaming layer, and usually a 898 byte
(typical) LeaseSet, and Session keys, bundled in the Garlic message by
the router. (The LeaseSet and Session Keys will not be bundled if an
ElGamal Session was previously established). Therefore, the goal of
fitting a complete HTTP request in a single 1KB I2NP message is not
always attainable. However, the selection of the MTU, together with
careful implementation of fragmentation and batching strategies in the
tunnel gateway processor, are important factors in network bandwidth,
latency, reliability, and efficiency, especially for long-lived
connections.

### Dataintegritet

Data integrity is assured by the gzip CRC-32 checksum implemented in
[the I2CP layer](#format). There is no checksum
field in the streaming protocol.

### Packet Encapsulation

Each packet is sent through I2P as a single message (or as an individual
clove in a [Garlic Message]()). Message
encapsulation is implemented in the underlying
[I2CP](), [I2NP](), and
[tunnel message]() layers. There is no
packet delimiter mechanism or payload length field in the streaming
protocol.

### Valgfri forsinkelse

Data packets may include an optional delay field specifying the
requested delay, in ms, before the receiver should ack the packet. Valid
values are 0 to 60000 inclusive. A value of 0 requests an immediate ack.
This is advisory only, and receivers should delay slightly so that
additional packets may be acknowledged with a single ack. Some
implementations may include an advisory value of (measured RTT / 2) in
this field. For nonzero optional delay values, receivers should limit
the maximum delay before sending an ack to a few seconds at most.
Optional delay values greater than 60000 indicate choking, see below.

### Receive Window and Choking

TCP headers include the receive window in bytes. The streaming protocol
does not contain a receive window, it uses only a simple choke/unchoke
indication. Each endpoint must maintain its own estimate of the far-end
receive window, in either bytes or packets. The recommended minimum
buffer size for receiver implementations is 128 packets or 217 KB
(approximately 128x1730). Because of I2P netowrk latency, packet drops,
and the resulting congestion control, a buffer of this size is rarely
filled. Overflow is, however, likely to occur on high-bandwidth \"local
loopback\" (same-router) connections.

To quickly indicate and smoothly recover from overflow conditions, there
is a simple mechanism for pushback in the streaming protocol. If a
packet is received with an optional delay field of value of 60001 or
higher, that indicates \"choking\" or a receive window of zero. A packet
with an optional delay field of value of 60000 or less indicates
\"unchoking\". Packets without an optional delay field do not affect the
choke/unchoke state.

After being choked, no more packets with data should be sent until the
transmitter is unchoked, except for occasional \"probe\" data packets to
compensate for possible lost unchoke packets. The choked endpoint should
start a \"persist timer\" to control the probing, as in TCP. The
unchoking endpoint should send several packets with this field set, or
continue sending them periodically until data packets are received
again. Maximum time to wait for unchoking is implementation-dependent.
Transmitter window size and congestion control strategy after being
unchoked is implementation-dependent.

### Congestion Control

The streaming lib uses standard slow-start (exponential window growth)
and congestion avoidance (linear window growth) phases, with exponential
backoff. Windowing and acknowledgments use packet count, not byte count.

### Lukk

Any packet, including one with the SYNCHRONIZE flag set, may have the
CLOSE flag sent as well. The connection is not closed until the peer
responds with the CLOSE flag. CLOSE packets may contain data as well.

### Ping / Pong

There is no ping function at the I2CP layer (equivalent to ICMP echo) or
in datagrams. This function is provided in streaming. Pings and pongs
may not be combined with a standard streaming packet; if the ECHO option
is set, then most other flags, options, ackThrough, sequenceNum, NACKs,
etc. are ignored.

A ping packet must have the ECHO, SIGNATURE_INCLUDED, and FROM_INCLUDED
flags set. The sendStreamId must be greater than zero, and the
receiveStreamId is ignored. The sendStreamId may or may not correspond
to an existing connection.

A pong packet must have the ECHO flag set. The sendStreamId must be
zero, and the receiveStreamId is the sendStreamId from the ping. Prior
to release 0.9.18, the pong packet does not include any payload that was
contained in the ping.

As of release 0.9.18, pings and pongs may contain a payload. The payload
in the ping, up to a maximum of 32 bytes, is returned in the pong.

Streaming may be configured to disable sending pongs with the
configuration i2p.streaming.answerPings=false.

### i2p.streaming.profile Notes {#profile}

This option supports two values; 1=bulk and 2=interactive. The option
provides a hint to the streaming library and/or router as to the traffic
pattern that is expected.

\"Bulk\" means to optimize for high bandwidth, possibly at the expense
of latency. This is the default. \"Interactive\" means to optimize for
low latency, possibly at the expense of bandwidth or efficiency.
Optimization strategies, if any, are implementation-dependent, and may
include changes outside of the streaming protocol.

Through API version 0.9.63, Java I2P would return an error for any value
other than 1 (bulk) and the tunnel would fail to start. As of API
0.9.64, Java I2P ignores the value. Through API version 0.9.63, i2pd
ignored this option; it is implemented in i2pd as of API 0.9.64.

While the streaming protocol includes a flag field to pass the profile
setting to the other end, this is not implemented in any known router.

### Control Block Sharing {#sharing}

The streaming lib supports \"TCP\" Control Block sharing. This shares
three important streaming lib parameters (window size, round trip time,
round trip time variance) across connections to the same remote peer.
This is used for \"temporal\" sharing at connection open/close time, not
\"ensemble\" sharing during a connection (See [RFC
2140](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2140.txt)). There is a separate share
per ConnectionManager (i.e. per local Destination) so that there is no
information leakage to other Destinations on the same router. The share
data for a given peer expires after a few minutes. The following Control
Block Sharing parameters can be set per router:

- RTT_DAMPENING = 0.75
- RTTDEV_DAMPENING = 0.75
- WINDOW_DAMPENING = 0.75

### Andre parametere {#other}

The following parameters are hardcoded, but may be of interest for
analysis:

- MIN_RESEND_DELAY = 100 ms (minimum RTO)
- MAX_RESEND_DELAY = 45 sec (maximum RTO)
- MIN_WINDOW_SIZE = 1
- TREND_COUNT = 3
- MIN_MESSAGE_SIZE = 512 (minimum MTU)
- INBOUND_BUFFER_SIZE = maxMessageSize \* (maxWindowSize + 2)
- INITIAL_TIMEOUT (valid only before RTT is sampled) = 9 sec
- \"alpha\" ( RTT dampening factor as per RFC 6298 ) = 0.125
- \"beta\" ( RTTDEV dampening factor as per RFC 6298 ) = 0.25
- \"K\" ( RTDEV multiplier as per RFC 6298 ) = 4
- PASSIVE_FLUSH_DELAY = 175 ms
- Maximum RTT estimate: 60 sec

### Historikk

The streaming library has grown organically for I2P - first mihi
implemented the \"mini streaming library\" as part of I2PTunnel, which
was limited to a window size of 1 message (requiring an ACK before
sending the next one), and then it was refactored out into a generic
streaming interface (mirroring TCP sockets) and the full streaming
implementation was deployed with a sliding window protocol and
optimizations to take into account the high bandwidth x delay product.
Individual streams may adjust the maximum packet size and other options.
The default message size is selected to fit precisely in two 1K I2NP
tunnel messages, and is a reasonable tradeoff between the bandwidth
costs of retransmitting lost messages, and the latency and overhead of
multiple messages.

## Future Work {#future}

The behavior of the streaming library has a profound impact on
application-level performance, and as such, is an important area for
further analysis.

- Additional tuning of the streaming lib parameters may be necessary.
- Another area for research is the interaction of the streaming lib
 with the NTCP and SSU transport layers. See [the NTCP discussion
 page]() for details.
- The interaction of the routing algorithms with the streaming lib
 strongly affects performance. In particular, random distribution of
 messages to multiple tunnels in a pool leads to a high degree of
 out-of-order delivery which results in smaller window sizes than
 would otherwise be the case. The router currently routes messages
 for a single from/to destination pair through a consistent set of
 tunnels, until tunnel expiration or delivery failure. The router\'s
 failure and tunnel selection algorithms should be reviewed for
 possible improvements.
- The data in the first SYN packet may exceed the receiver\'s MTU.
- The DELAY_REQUESTED field could be used more.
- Duplicate initial SYNCHRONIZE packets on short-lived streams may not
 be recognized and removed.
- Don\'t send the MTU in a retransmission.
- Data is sent along unless the outbound window is full. (i.e.
 no-Nagle or TCP_NODELAY) Probably should have a configuration option
 for this.
- zzz has added debug code to the streaming library to log packets in
 a wireshark-compatible (pcap) format; Use this to further analyze
 performance. The format may require enhancement to map more
 streaming lib parameters to TCP fields.
- There are proposals to replace the streaming lib with standard TCP
 (or perhaps a null layer together with raw sockets). This would
 unfortunately be incompatible with the streaming lib but it would be
 good to compare the performance of the two.

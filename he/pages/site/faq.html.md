## I2P Router Help

### [ [What systems will I2P run on?](#systems) ]{.permalink} {#systems}

I2P is written in the [Java programming
language](). It has been tested on Windows, Linux,
FreeBSD and OSX. An [Android port]() is also
available.

In terms of memory usage, I2P is configured to use 128 MB of RAM by
default. This is sufficient for browsing and IRC usage. However, other
activities may require greater memory allocation. For example, if one
wishes to run a high-bandwidth router, participate in I2P torrents or
serve high-traffic hidden services, a higher amount of memory is
required.

In terms of CPU usage, I2P has been tested to run on modest systems such
as the [Raspberry Pi]() range of single-board
computers. As I2P makes heavy use of cryptographic techniques, a
stronger CPU will be better suited to handle the workload generated by
I2P as well as tasks related to the rest of the system (i.e. Operating
System, GUI, Other processes e.g. Web Browsing).

A comparison of some of the available Java Runtime Environments (JRE) is
available here: [](). Using Sun/Oracle
Java or OpenJDK is recommended.

### [ [Is installing Java required to use I2P?](#java)]{.permalink} {#java}

While the main I2P client implementation requires Java, there are
several [alternative clients]() which don\'t
require Java.

### [ [What is an \"I2P Site?\"](#I2P%20Site)]{.permalink} {#I2P Site}

Formerly called an eepSite, an I2P Site is a website that is hosted
anonymously, a hidden service which is accessible through your web
browser. It can be accessed by setting your web browser\'s HTTP proxy to
use the I2P web proxy (typically it listens on localhost port 4444), and
browsing to the site. Detailed instructions for configuring your browse
can be found on the [browser configuration
page]().

### [ [What do the Active x/y numbers mean in the router console?](#active)]{.permalink} {#active}

x is the number of peers you\'ve sent or received a message from
successfully in the last minute, y is the number of peers seen in the
last hour or so. Try hovering your cursor over the other lines of
information for a brief description.

### [ [I am opposed to certain types of content. How do I keep from distributing, storing, or accessing them?](#badcontent)]{.permalink} {#badcontent}

I2P traffic that transits through your router is encrypted with several
layers of encryption. Except in the case of a serious security
vulnerability (of which none are currently known), it is not possible to
know the content, origin or destination of routed traffic.

- **Distribution**\
 All traffic on the I2P network is encrypted in multiple layers. You
 don\'t know a message\'s contents, source, or destination. Traffic
 is internal to the I2P network, you are not an [exit node](#exit)
 (referred to as an outproxy in our documentation).
- **Storage**\
 The I2P network does not do distributed storage of content, this has
 to be specifically installed and configured by the user (with
 Tahoe-LAFS, for example). That is a feature of a different anonymous
 network, [Freenet](http://freenetproject.org/). By running an I2P
 router, you are not storing content for anyone.
- **Access**\
 Your router will not request any content without your specific
 instruction to do so.

### [[Is it possible to block I2P?](#blocking)]{.permalink} {#blocking}

Yes, by far the easiest and most common way is by blocking bootstrap, or
\"Reseed\" servers. Completely blocking all obfuscated traffic would
work as well (although it would break many, many other things that are
not I2P and most are not willing to go this far). In the case of reseed
blocking, there is a reseed bundle on Github, blocking it will also
block Github. You can reseed over a proxy (many can be found on Internet
if you do not want to use Tor) or share reseed bundles on a
friend-to-friend basis offline.

### [ [In `wrapper.log` I see an error that states \"`Protocol family unavailable`\" when loading the Router Console](#protocolfamily)]{.permalink} {#protocolfamily}

Often this error will occur with any network enabled java software on
some systems that are configured to use IPv6 by default. There are a few
ways to solve this:

- On Linux based systems, you can
 `echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/bindv6only`
- Look for the following lines in `wrapper.config`.\
 `#wrapper.java.additional.5=-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true`\
 `#wrapper.java.additional.6=-Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=false`\
 \
 If the lines are there, uncomment them by removing the \"#\"s. If
 the lines are not there, add them without the \"#\"s.

Another option would be to remove the **::1** from
`~/.i2p/clients.config`

**WARNING**: For any changes to `wrapper.config` to take effect, you
must completely stop the router and the wrapper. Clicking *Restart* on
your router console will NOT reread this file! You must click
*Shutdown*, wait 11 minutes, then start I2P.

### [ [Most of the I2P Sites within I2P are down?](#down)]{.permalink} {#down}

If you consider every I2P Site that has ever been created, yes, most of
them are down. People and I2P Sites come and go. A good way to get
started in I2P is check out a list of I2P Sites that are currently up.
[]() tracks active I2P Sites.

### [ [Why is I2P listening on port 32000?](#port32000)]{.permalink} {#port32000}

The Tanuki java service wrapper that we use opens this port ---bound to
localhost--- in order to communicate with software running inside the
JVM. When the JVM is launched it is given a key so it can connect to the
wrapper. After the JVM establishes its connection to the wrapper, the
wrapper refuses any additional connections.

More information can be found in the [wrapper
documentation](http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.com/doc/english/prop-port.html).

## Configuration

### [ [How do I configure my browser?](#browserproxy)]{.permalink} {#browserproxy}

The proxy config for different browsers is on a [separate
page]() with screenshots. More advanced
configs with external tools, such as the browser plug-in FoxyProxy or
the proxy server Privoxy, are possible but could introduce leaks in your
setup.

### [ [How do I connect to IRC within I2P?](#irc)]{.permalink} {#irc}

A tunnel to the main IRC server within I2P, Irc2P, is created when I2P
is installed (see the [I2PTunnel configuration
page](http://localhost:7657/i2ptunnel/index.jsp)), and is automatically
started when the I2P router starts. To connect to it, tell your IRC
client to connect to `localhost 6668`. HexChat-like client users can
create a new network with the server `localhost/6668` (remember to tick
\"Bypass proxy server\" if you have a proxy server configured). Weechat
users can use the following command to add a new network: 

` `

 /server add irc2p localhost/6668
 

[Click on the](#myI2P%20Site) [Website](http://localhost:7658/) link at
the top of your router console for instructions.

### If I host a website at I2P at home, containing only HTML and CSS, is it dangerous? {#hosting}

If you\'re hosting a personal blog or doing something otherwise
non-sensitive, then you are obviously in little danger. If you have
privacy needs that are basically non-specific, you are in little danger.
If you are hosting something sensitive, then your services will go down
at the same time that your router goes down. Someone who observes your
downtime and correlates it to real-world events could probably
de-anonymize you with enough effort. I2P has defenses available against
this like multihoming or Tahoe-LAFS, but they require additional set up
and are only appropriate for some threat models. There is no magic
solution, protecting yourself from a real threat will take real
consideration in any case.

### How Does I2P find \".i2p\" websites? {#addresses}

The I2P Address Book application maps human-readable names to long-term
destinations, associated with services, making it more like a hosts file
or a contact list than a network database or a DNS service. It\'s also
local-first there is no recognized global namespace, you decide what any
given .i2p domain maps to in the end. The middle-ground is something
called a \"Jump Service\" which provides a human-readable name by
redirecting you to a page where you will be asked \"Do you give the I2P
router permission to call \$SITE_CRYPTO_KEY the name \$SITE_NAME.i2p\"
or something to that effect. Once it\'s in your address book, you can
generate your own jump URL\'s to help share the site with others.

### How do I add addresses to the Address Book? {#addressbook}

You cannot add an address without knowing at least the base32 or base64
of the site you want to visit. The \"hostname\" which is human-readable
is only an alias for the cryptographic address, which corresponds to the
base32 or base64. Without the cryptographic address, there is no way to
access an I2P Site, this is by design. Distributing the address to
people who do not know it yet is usually the responsibility of the Jump
service provider. Visiting an I2P Site which is unknown will trigger the
use of a Jump service. stats.i2p is the most reliable Jump service.

If you\'re hosting a site via i2ptunnel, then it won\'t have a
registration with a jump service yet. To give it a URL locally, then
visit the configuration page and click the button that says \"Add to
Local Address Book.\" Then go to http://127.0.0.1:7657/dns to look up
the addresshelper URL and share it.

### [ [What ports does I2P use?](#ports)]{.permalink} {#ports}

The ports that are used by I2P can be divided into 2 sections:

1. Internet-facing ports, which are used for communication with other
 I2P routers
2. Local ports, for local connections

These are described in detail below.

1. Internet-facing ports\
 Note: Since release 0.7.8, new installs do not use port 8887; a
 random port between 9000 and 31000 is selected when the program is
 run for the first time. The selected port is shown on the router
 [configuration page](http://127.0.0.1:7657/confignet).\
 **OUTBOUND**
 - UDP from the random port listed on the [configuration
 page](http://127.0.0.1:7657/confignet) to arbitrary remote UDP
 ports, allowing for replies
 - TCP from random high ports to arbitrary remote TCP ports
 - Outbound UDP on port 123, allowing for replies. This is
 necessary for I2P\'s internal time sync (via SNTP - querying a
 random SNTP host in pool.ntp.org or another server you specify)

 **INBOUND**
 - (Optional, recommended) UDP to the port noted on the
 [configuration page](http://127.0.0.1:7657/confignet) from
 arbitrary locations
 - (Optional, recommended) TCP to the port noted on [configuration
 page](http://127.0.0.1:7657/confignet) from arbitrary locations
 - Inbound TCP can be disabled on the [configuration
 page](http://127.0.0.1:7657/confignet)
2. Local I2P ports, listening only to local connections by default,
 except where noted:\
 PORT PURPOSE DESCRIPTION
 ------------- ------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 6668 IRC proxy May be disabled or changed on the i2ptunnel page in the router console. May also be configured to be bound to a specific interface or all interfaces.
 7652 HTTP TCP event listener Binds to the LAN address. May be changed with advanced config `i2np.upnp.HTTPPort=nnnn`. May be disabled on [confignet](http://127.0.0.1:7657/confignet).
 7653 UPnP SSDP UDP search response listener Binds to the LAN address. May be changed with advanced config `i2np.upnp.SSDPPort=nnnn`. May be disabled on [confignet](http://127.0.0.1:7657/confignet).
 7654 I2P Client Protocol port Used by client apps. May be changed to a different port on [configclients](http://127.0.0.1:7657/configclients) but this is not recommended. May be to bind to a different interface or all interfaces, or disabled, on [configclients](http://127.0.0.1:7657/configclients).
 7655 UDP for SAM bridge A higher level socket API for clients Only opened when a SAM V3 client requests a UDP session. May be enabled/disabled on [configclients](http://127.0.0.1:7657/configclients). May be changed in the `clients.config` file with the SAM command line option `sam.udp.port=nnnn`.
 7656 SAM bridge A higher level socket API for clients Disabled by default for new installs as of release 0.6.5. May be enabled/disabled on [configclients](http://127.0.0.1:7657/configclients). May be changed in the `clients.config` file.
 7657 Your [router console](http://127.0.0.1:7657) May be disabled in the `clients.config`file. May also be configured to be bound to a specific interface or all interfaces in that file.
 7658 Your [I2P Site](http://127.0.0.1:7658) May be disabled in the `clients.config` file. May also be configured to be bound to a specific interface or all interfaces in the `jetty.xml` file.
 7659 Outgoing mail to smtp.postman.i2p May be disabled or changed on the i2ptunnel page in the router console. May also be configured to be bound to a specific interface or all interfaces.
 7660 Incoming mail from pop3.postman.i2p May be disabled or changed on the i2ptunnel page in the router console. May also be configured to be bound to a specific interface or all interfaces.
 7670 (8998) gitssh.idk.i2p git over ssh This used to be port 8998 for monotone. Elder installations may still have that and not this one. May be disabled or changed on the i2ptunnel page in the router console. May also be configured to be bound to a specific interface or all interfaces.
 31000 Local connection to the wrapper control channel port Outbound to 32000 only, does not listen on this port. Starts at 31000 and will increment until 31999 looking for a free port. To change, see the [wrapper documentation](http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.com/doc/english/prop-port.html). For more information see [below](#port32000).
 32000 Local control channel for the service wrapper To change, see the [wrapper documentation](http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.com/doc/english/prop-port.html). For more information see [below](#port32000).

The local I2P ports and the I2PTunnel ports do not need to be reachable
from remote machines, but \*should\* be reachable locally. You can also
create additional ports for I2PTunnel instances via
http://localhost:7657/i2ptunnel/ (and in turn, would need to get your
firewall to allow you local access, but not remote access, unless
desired).

So, to summarize, nothing needs to be reachable by unsolicited remote
peers, but if you can configure your NAT/firewall to allow inbound UDP
and TCP the [outbound facing port](http://localhost:7657/config),
you\'ll get better performance. You will also need to be able to send
outbound UDP packets to arbitrary remote peers (blocking IPs randomly
with something like PeerGuardian only hurts you - don\'t do it).

### [ [I\'m missing lots of hosts in my address book. What are some good subscription links?](#subscriptions)]{.permalink} {#subscriptions}

This question can be answered in 3 parts:

1. My router often displays a message saying \"Website Not Found In
 Address Book\", why do I see this message?

 Human-readable addresses such as *http://website.i2p* are references
 to a long, random string known as a **destination**. These
 references are registered and stored at address book services such
 as stats.i2p, which is run by zzz. You will often encounter a
 \"b32\" address. A \"b32\" is a hash (specifically, a
 [SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) hash) of the
 destination. This hash is appended with \".b32.i2p\" and serves as a
 convenient way to link to your hidden service, without requiring any
 registration on an address book service.

 It is possible to add subscriptions to your router\'s configuration
 which may reduce the frequency of these messages.

2. What is an address book subscription?

 This is a list of files hosted on various I2P websites each of which
 contain a list of I2P hosts and their associated destinations.

 The address book is located at <http://localhost:7657/dns> where
 further information can be found.

3. What are some good address book subscription links?

 You may try the following:

 ::: links
 <http://stats.i2p/cgi-bin/newhosts.txt>
 <http://identiguy.i2p/hosts.txt>
 :::

### [ [How can I access the web console from my other machines or password protect it?](#remote_webconsole)]{.permalink} {#remote_webconsole}

For security purposes, the router\'s admin console by default only
listens for connections on the local interface. There are two methods
for accessing the console remotely:

1. SSH Tunnel
2. Configuring your console to be available on a Public IP address with
 a username & password

These are detailed below:

1. SSH Tunnel\
 If you are running a Unix-like Operating System, this is the easiest
 method for remotely accessing your I2P console. (Note: SSH server
 software is available for systems running Windows, for example
 <https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH>)\
 Once you have configured SSH access to your system, the \'-L\' flag
 is passed to SSH with appropriate arguments - for example: ` `

 ssh -L 7657:localhost:7657 (System_IP)
 

 where \'(System_IP)\' is replaced with your System\'s IP address.
 This command forwards port 7657 (the number before the first colon)
 to the remote system\'s (as specified by the string \'localhost\'
 between the first and second colons) port 7657 (the number after the
 second colon). Your remote I2P console will now be available on your
 local system as \'http://localhost:7657\' and will be available for
 as long as your SSH session is active. If you would like to start an
 SSH session without initiating a shell on the remote system, you can
 add the \'-N\' flag: ` `

 ssh -NL 7657:localhost:7657 (System_IP)
 

2. Configuring your console to be available on a Public IP address with
 a username & password\
 1. Open `~/.i2p/clients.config` and replace ` `

 clientApp.0.args=7657 ::1,127.0.0.1 ./webapps/
 

 with ` `

 clientApp.0.args=7657 ::1,127.0.0.1,(System_IP) ./webapps/
 

 where you replace (System_IP) with your system\'s public IP
 address

 2. Go to <http://localhost:7657/configui> and add a console
 username and password if desired - Adding a username & password
 is highly recommended to secure your I2P console from tampering,
 which could lead to de-anonymization.

 3. Go to <http://localhost:7657/index> and hit \"Graceful
 restart\", which restarts the JVM and reloads the client
 applications

 After that fires up, you should now be able to reach your console
 remotely. Load the router console at `http://(System_IP):7657` and
 you will be prompted for the username and password you specified in
 step 2 above if your browser supports the authentication popup.\
 NOTE: You can specify 0.0.0.0 in the above configuration. This
 specifies an interface, not a network or netmask. 0.0.0.0 means
 \"bind to all interfaces\", so it can be reachable on 127.0.0.1:7657
 as well as any LAN/WAN IP. Be careful when using this option as the
 console will be available on ALL addresses configured on your
 system.

### [ [How can I use applications from my other machines?](#remote_i2cp)]{.permalink} {#remote_i2cp}

Please see the previous answer for instructions on using SSH Port
Forwarding, and also see this page in your console:
<http://localhost:7657/configi2cp>

### [ [Is it possible to use I2P as a SOCKS proxy?](#socks)]{.permalink} {#socks}

The SOCKS proxy has been functional since release 0.7.1. SOCKS 4/4a/5
are supported. I2P does not have a SOCKS outproxy so it is limited to
use within I2P only.

Many applications leak sensitive information that could identify you on
the Internet and this is a risk that one should be aware of when using
the I2P SOCKS proxy. I2P only filters connection data, but if the
program you intend to run sends this information as content, I2P has no
way to protect your anonymity. For example, some mail applications will
send the IP address of the machine they are running on to a mail server.
There is no way for I2P to filter this, thus using I2P to \'socksify\'
existing applications is possible, but extremely dangerous.

If you would like more information on the socks proxy application
anyway, there are some helpful hints on the [socks
page]().

### [ [How do I access IRC, BitTorrent, or other services on the regular Internet?](#proxy_other)]{.permalink} {#proxy_other}

Unless an outproxy has been specifically set up for the service you want
to connect to, this cannot be done. There are only three types of
outproxies running right now: HTTP, HTTPS, and email. Note that there is
no SOCKS outproxy. If this type of service is required, we recommend
that you use Tor. Please be aware that the Tor project [recommends
against using BitTorrent over
Tor](https://blog.torproject.org/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea), as
there are serious anonymity-related issues associated with doing so.

## Privacy and Safety

### [ [Is my router an \"exit node\" to the regular Internet? I don\'t want it to be.](#exit)]{.permalink} {#exit}

No. Unlike [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/), \"exit nodes\" - or
\"outproxies\" as they are referred to on the I2P network - are not an
inherent part of the network. Only volunteers who specifically set up
and run separate applications will relay traffic to the regular
Internet. There are very, very few of these. By default, I2P\'s HTTP
Proxy (configured to run on port 4444) includes a single outproxy:
false.i2p. This is run on a voluntary basis by Meeh. There is an
[outproxy guide]() available on our forums, if
you would like to learn more about running an outproxy.

### [[Is using I2P Safe?](#safe)]{.permalink} {#safe}

Before you use I2P, use Basic Computer Hygiene Always! Apply your OS
vendor provided software updates in a prompt manner. Be aware of the
state of your firewall and anti-virus status if you use one. Always get
your software from authentic sources.

I2P strives to be safe in it\'s default configuration for all users.

It may be dangerous to use I2P in what the project calls \"Strict
Countries\" where the law may not be clear on anonymizing software and
where risks are judged to be fairly high. Most I2P peers are not in
those strict countries and the ones that are, are placed in \"Hidden
Mode\" where they interact with the rest of the network in more limited
ways, so that they are less visible to network observers.

### [ [I see IP addresses of all other I2P nodes in the router console. Does that mean my IP address is visible by others?](#netdb_ip)]{.permalink} {#netdb_ip}

Yes, and this is how a fully distributed peer-to-peer network works.
Every node participates in routing packets for others, so your IP
address must be known to establish connections.

While the fact that your computer runs I2P is public, nobody can see
your activities in it. You can\'t say if a user behind this IP address
is sharing files, hosting a website, doing research or just running a
node to contribute bandwidth to the project.

### [[Is it easy to detect the use of I2P by analyzing network traffic?](#detection)]{.permalink} {#detection}

It can be deduced that somebody is using the I2P network with some
reliability, but it is a little difficult to know for sure. The most
reliable way to know for sure would be to have a computer with a fairly
stable IP address that you suspect is an I2P user, and a bunch of
computers you control on different networks all running I2P. When one of
them connects to your suspected computer, you will be able to see their
I2P router in the netDB. This might take time, and it might never
happen. You could also try blocking all obfuscated traffic on a
particular network until you\'re sure every I2P router on that network
has lost all of it\'s peers. At that point, they\'ll reach out to reseed
servers to get more peers, which a network administrator can probably
observe.

### [ [Is using an outproxy safe?](#proxy_safe)]{.permalink} {#proxy_safe}

 I2P does not encrypt the Internet, neither does Tor - for
example, through [Transport Layer Security
(TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security). I2P and
Tor both aim to transport your traffic as-is securely and anonymously
over the corresponding network, to its destination. Any unencrypted
traffic generated at your system will arrive at the outproxy (on I2P) or
the exit node (on Tor) as unencrypted traffic. This means that you are
vulnerable to snooping by the outproxy operators. One way to protect
your outproxy traffic against this is to ensure that any traffic that
will be handled by the outproxy is encrypted with TLS.

For more information, you may read the Tor FAQ\'s answer to this

In addition, you may be vulnerable to collusion between the outproxy
operator and operators of other I2P services, if you use the same
tunnels (\"shared clients\"). There is additional discussion about this
on [](http:///topics/217). This discussion
has been [mirrored on our forums]() as well.

What about \"De-Anonymizing\" attacks?

 Reducing anonymity is typically done by A) identifying
characteristics that are consistent across anonymous identities or B)
identifying ephemeral characteristics of repeated connections. We say
\"reducing\" anonymity because many of these characteristics are shared
by many of our users, making these anonymity \"sets,\" the smaller the
anonymity set and the more small sets you belong to, the more brittle
your anonymity.

Attacks on I2P in the past have relied on correlating NetDB storage and
verification, by randomizing the delay between storage and verification,
we reduce the consistency with which that verification can be linked to
I2P activity, thereby limiting the utility of that data point.

Attacks on software configured to work with I2P are out of scope for I2P
to solve. When browsing I2P or hosting I2P services, it\'s is the
responsibility of the user to consider their threat model. Browsers are
particularly problematic due to fingerprinting attacks, and the wide
variety of information that can be gleaned from them. Using a
standardized browsing profile is thought to help mitigate the impact of
fingerprinting.

## Reseeds

### [ [My router has been up for several minutes and has zero or very few connections](#reseed) ]{.permalink} {#reseed}

New installations of I2P carry out the reseeding process automatically,
as well as when the number of known peers falls to a drastically low
value. If you need to carry out a reseed of your router, please see the
[reseed instructions](#manual_reseed).

### [ [How do I reseed manually?](#manual_reseed)]{.permalink} {#manual_reseed}

An I2P router only needs to be seeded once, to join the network for the
first time. Reseeding involves fetching multiple \"RouterInfo\" files
(bundled into a signed zip-file) from at least two predefined server
URLs picked from a volunteer-run group of non-private internet HTTPS
servers.

A typical symptom of a failed reseed is the \"Known\" indicator (on the
left sidebar of the router console) displaying a very small value (often
less than 5) which does not increase. This can occur, among other
things, if your local firewall limits outbound traffic or if the reseed
request is blocked entirely.

If you are stuck behind an ISP firewall or filter, you can use the
following manual method (non-automated technical solution) to join the
I2P network.

Please contact a known trustworthy friend who has a running I2P router,
and ask them for help with reseeding your I2P router. Request that they
send you a reseed file exported from their running I2P router. It is
vital that the file is exchanged over a secure channel, e.g. encrypted
to avoid external tampering (PGP Sign, Encrypt and Verified with a
trusted public key). The file itself is unsigned, so please accept files
only from known trusted friends. Never import a reseed file if you can
not verify its source.

Do not reveal this file in any case to unknown users, since it contains
sensitive private data (100 RouterInfo) from your own I2P router! In
order to protect your anonymity: you may wait a few random hours/days
before you share the file with your trusted friend. It is also advisable
to use this procedure sparingly (\< 2 per week).

#### General guidelines for manual reseeding of I2P

- Do not publicly publish the reseed file or share these files with a
 friend of a friend!
- This file should be used only for a very limited number of friends
 (\< 3)!
- The file is valid only a few days (\< 20)!

## Internet Access/Performance

### [ [I can\'t access regular Internet sites through I2P.](#outproxy)]{.permalink} {#outproxy}

I2P is primarily not intended, nor designed, to be used as a proxy to
the regular internet. With that said, there are services which are
provided by volunteers that act as proxies to non-private internet based
content - these are referred to as \"outproxies\" on the I2P network.
There is an outproxy configured by default in I2P\'s HTTP client
tunnel - false.i2p. While this service does currently exist, there is no
guarantee that it will always be there as it is not an official service
provided by the I2P project. If your main requirement from an anonymous
network is the ability to access non-private internet resources, we
would recommend using [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/).

### [ [I can\'t access https:// or ftp:// sites through I2P.](#https)]{.permalink} {#https}

- **HTTPS**\
 Within I2P, there is no requirement to use HTTPS. All traffic is
 encrypted end-to-end, any further encryption, e.g. with the use of
 HTTPS, doesn\'t create any further anonymity-related benefits.
 However, if one would like to use HTTPS or has a requirement to do
 so, the existing default I2P HTTP Proxy has support for HTTPS
 traffic. Any hidden service operator would have to specifically set
 up and enable HTTPS access.
- **FTP**\
 FTP is not supported for technical reasons. There are no FTP
 \"outproxies\" to the Internet---it may not even be possible to set
 up one. Any other kind of outproxy may work if it\'s set up with a
 standard tunnel. If you would like to set up some type of outproxy,
 carefully research the potential risks. The I2P community may or may
 not be able to help with the technical aspects, feel free to ask. As
 explained several times above, any existing outproxy isn\'t a core
 part of the network. They are services run by individuals and they
 may or may not be operational at any given time.

### [ [My router is using a large amount of CPU, what can I do about this?](#cpu) ]{.permalink} {#cpu}

There are many possible causes of high CPU usage. Here is a checklist:

- **Java Runtime Environment**\
 Try to use either OpenJDK or Sun/Oracle Java if it\'s available for
 your system. You can check which version of java you have installed
 by typing `java -version` at a command/shell prompt. Performance
 tends to suffer with other implementations of java.
- **File sharing applications, e.g. BitTorrent**\
 Are you running a BitTorrent client over I2P? Try reducing the
 number of torrents, the bandwidth limits, or try turning it off
 completely to see if that helps.
- **High bandwidth settings**\
 Are your bandwidth limits set too high? It is possible that too much
 traffic is going through your I2P router and it is overloaded. Try
 reducing the setting for *share bandwidth percentage* on the
 [configuration](http://localhost:7657/config) page.
- **I2P Version**\
 Make sure that you\'re running the latest version of I2P to get the
 benefits of increased performance and bug fixes.
- **Memory allocation**\
 Has enough memory been set aside for use by I2P? Look at the memory
 graph on [the graphs page](http://localhost:7657/graphs) to see if
 the memory usage is \"pegged\"---the JVM is spending most of its
 time in garbage collection. Increase the setting
 `wrapper.java.maxmemory` in the file `wrapper.config`.
- **Bursts of high-usage vs. constant 100% usage**\
 Is the CPU usage simply higher than you would like, or is it pegged
 at 100% for a long time? If it is pegged, this could be a bug. Look
 in the logs for clues.
- **Java-related**\
 You may be using the Java-based BigInteger library instead of the
 native version, especially if you are running on a new or unusual OS
 or hardware (OpenSolaris, mipsel, etc.). See the [jbigi
 page]() for instructions on diagnosing,
 building, and testing methods.
- **Participating tunnels**\
 If your native jbigi library is working fine, the biggest user of
 CPU may be routing traffic for participating tunnels. This uses CPU
 because at each hop a layer of encryption must be decoded. You can
 limit participating traffic in two ways - by reducing the share
 bandwidth on the [confignet](http://localhost:7657/confignet.jsp)
 page, or by setting `router.maxParticipatingTunnels=nnn` on the
 [configadvanced](http://localhost:7657/configadvanced.jsp) page.

### [ [My router has very few active peers, is this OK?](#peers)]{.permalink} {#peers}

If your router has 10 or more active peers, everything is fine. The
router should maintain connections to a few peers at all times. The best
way to stay \"better-connected\" to the network is to share more
bandwidth. The amount of bandwidth that is shared by the router can be
changed on the configuration page: <http://localhost:7657/config>

### [ [My active peers / known peers / participating tunnels / connections / bandwidth vary dramatically over time! Is anything wrong?](#vary)]{.permalink} {#vary}

No, there isn\'t anything wrong. This is normal behavior. All routers
adjust dynamically to changing network conditions and demands. Routers
come online and go offline depending on whether the system it is
installed on is operational or not, as well as whether there is an
available network connection. Your router is constantly updating its
local Network Database. Tunnels which your router is participating in
expire every 10 minutes and may or may not be rebuilt through your
router.

### [ [What makes downloads, torrents, web browsing, and everything else slower on I2P as compared to the regular internet?](#slow)]{.permalink} {#slow}

The encryption and routing within the I2P network adds a substantial
amount of overhead and limits bandwidth. We can try to clarify this with
the aid of a diagram:

![](/_static/images/i2p_traffic_path.jpg)

In this diagram, the path that some I2P traffic takes as it travels
through the network is traced. A user\'s I2P router is denoted by the
box labeled \'A\' and an I2P Hidden Service (for example, the
http://stats.i2p website) is labelled as \'B\'. Both the client and the
server are using 3-hop tunnels, these hops are represented by the boxes
labelled \'P\', \'Q\', \'R\', \'X\', \'Y\', \'Z\', \'P_1\', \'Q_1\',
\'R\'\_1, \'X_1\', \'Y_1\' and \'Z_1\'.

The boxes labelled \'P\', \'Q\' and \'R\' represent an outbound tunnel
for A while the boxes labelled \'X_1\', \'Y_1\', \'Z_1\' represent an
outbound tunnel for \'B\'. Similarly, the boxes labelled \'X\', \'Y\'
and \'Z\' represent and inbound tunnel for \'B\' while the boxes
labelled \'P_1\', \'Q_1\' and \'R_1\' represent an inbound tunnel for
\'A\'. The arrows in between the boxes show the direction of traffic.
The text above and below the arrows detail some example bandwidth
between a pair of hops as well as example latencies.

When both client and server are using 3-hop tunnels throughout, a total
of 12 other I2P routers are involved in relaying traffic. 6 peers relay
traffic from the client to the server which is split into a 3-hop
outbound tunnel from \'A\' (\'P\', \'Q\', \'R\') and a 3-hop inbound
tunnel to \'B\' (\'X\', \'Y\', \'Z\'). Similarly, 6 peers relay traffic
from the server to back to the client.

First, we can consider latency - the time that it takes for a request
from a client to traverse the I2P network, reach the the server and
traverse back to the client. Adding up all latencies we see that:

` `

 40 + 100 + 20 + 60 + 80 + 10 + 30 ms (client to server)
 + 60 + 40 + 80 + 60 + 100 + 20 + 40 ms (server to client) 
 -----------------------------------
 TOTAL: 740 ms

The total round-trip time in our example adds up to 740 ms - certainly
much higher than what one would normally see while browsing regular
internet websites.

Second, we can consider available bandwidth. This is determined through
the slowest link between hops from the client and server as well as when
traffic is being transmitted by the server to the client. For traffic
going from the client to the server, we see that the available bandwidth
in our example between hops \'R\' & \'X\' as well as hops \'X\' & \'Y\'
is 32 KB/s. Despite higher available bandwidth between the other hops,
these hops will act as a bottleneck and will limit the maximum available
bandwidth for traffic from \'A\' to \'B\' at 32 KB/s. Similarly, tracing
the path from server to client shows that there is maximum bandwidth of
64 KB/s - between hops \'Z_1\' & \'Y_1, \'Y_1\' & \'X_1\' and \'Q_1\' &
\'P_1\'.

We recommend increasing your bandwidth limits. This helps the network by
increasing the amount of available bandwidth which will in turn improve
your I2P experience. Bandwidth settings are located on the
<http://localhost:7657/config> page. Please be aware of your internet
connection\'s limits as determined by your ISP, and adjust your settings
accordingly.

We also recommend setting a sufficient amount of shared bandwidth - this
allows for participating tunnels to be routed through your I2P router.
Allowing participating traffic keeps your router well-integrated in the
network and improves your transfer speeds.

I2P is a work in progress. Lots of improvements and fixes are being
implemented, and, generally speaking, running the latest release will
help your performance. If you haven\'t, [install the latest
release]().

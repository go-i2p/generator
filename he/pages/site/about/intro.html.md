Comparisons

There are a great many other applications and projects working on
anonymous communication and I2P has been inspired by much of their
efforts. This is not a comprehensive list of anonymity resources - both
freehaven\'s [Anonymity
Bibliography](http://freehaven.net/anonbib/topic.html) and GNUnet\'s
[related projects](https://www.gnunet.org/links/) serve that purpose
well. That said, a few systems stand out for further comparison. The
following have individual comparison pages:

- [Tor / Onion Routing]()
- [Freenet]()
- [GNUnet]()

The following are discussed on the [other networks
page:]()

- RetroShare
- Morphmix / Tarzan
- Mixminion / Mixmaster
- JAP
- MUTE / AntsP2P
- Haystack

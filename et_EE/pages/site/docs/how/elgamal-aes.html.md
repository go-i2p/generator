 ElGamal/AES +
SessionTag Encryption April 2020 0.9.46 

## Overview

ElGamal/AES+SessionTags is used for end-to-end encryption.

As an unreliable, unordered, message based system, I2P uses a simple
combination of asymmetric and symmetric encryption algorithms to provide
data confidentiality and integrity to garlic messages. As a whole, the
combination is referred to as ElGamal/AES+SessionTags, but that is an
excessively verbose way to describe the use of 2048bit ElGamal, AES256,
SHA256, and 32 byte nonces.

The first time a router wants to encrypt a garlic message to another
router, they encrypt the keying material for an AES256 session key with
ElGamal and append the AES256/CBC encrypted payload after that encrypted
ElGamal block. In addition to the encrypted payload, the AES encrypted
section contains the payload length, the SHA256 hash of the unencrypted
payload, as well as a number of \"session tags\" - random 32 byte
nonces. The next time the sender wants to encrypt a garlic message to
another router, rather than ElGamal encrypt a new session key they
simply pick one of the previously delivered session tags and AES encrypt
the payload like before, using the session key used with that session
tag, prepended with the session tag itself. When a router receives a
garlic encrypted message, they check the first 32 bytes to see if it
matches an available session tag - if it does, they simply AES decrypt
the message, but if it does not, they ElGamal decrypt the first block.

Each session tag can be used only once so as to prevent internal
adversaries from unnecessarily correlating different messages as being
between the same routers. The sender of an ElGamal/AES+SessionTag
encrypted message chooses when and how many tags to deliver, prestocking
the recipient with enough tags to cover a volley of messages. Garlic
messages may detect the successful tag delivery by bundling a small
additional message as a clove (a \"delivery status message\") - when the
garlic message arrives at the intended recipient and is decrypted
successfully, this small delivery status message is one of the cloves
exposed and has instructions for the recipient to send the clove back to
the original sender (through an inbound tunnel, of course). When the
original sender receives this delivery status message, they know that
the session tags bundled in the garlic message were successfully
delivered.

Session tags themselves have a short lifetime, after which they are
discarded if not used. In addition, the quantity stored for each key is
limited, as are the number of keys themselves - if too many arrive,
either new or old messages may be dropped. The sender keeps track
whether messages using session tags are getting through, and if there
isn\'t sufficient communication it may drop the ones previously assumed
to be properly delivered, reverting back to the full expensive ElGamal
encryption. A session will continue to exist until all its tags are
exhausted or expire.

Sessions are unidirectional. Tags are delivered from Alice to Bob, and
Alice then uses the tags, one by one, in subsequent messages to Bob.

Sessions may be established between Destinations, between Routers, or
between a Router and a Destination. Each Router and Destination
maintains its own Session Key Manager to keep track of Session Keys and
Session Tags. Separate Session Key Managers prevents correlation of
multiple Destinations to each other or a Router by adversaries.

## Message Reception

Each message received has one of two the two possible conditions:

1. It is part of an existing session and contains a Session Tag and an
 AES encrypted block
2. It is for a new session and contains both ElGamal and AES encrypted
 blocks

When a router receives a message, it will first assume it is from an
existing session and attempt to look up the Session Tag and decrypt the
following data using AES. If that fails, it will assume it is for a new
session and attempt to decrypt it using ElGamal.

## New Session Message Specification {#new}

A New Session ElGamal Message contains two parts, an encrypted ElGamal
block and an encrypted AES block.

The encrypted message contains:


+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ \|
\| + + \| ElGamal Encrypted Block \| \~ \~ \| \| +
+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ \| \| \|
+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ + \| \| + + \| AES Encrypted Block \| \~ \~ \| \| +
+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ \| + +\-\-\--+\-\-\--+


### ElGamal Block

The encrypted ElGamal Block is always 514 bytes long.

The unencrypted ElGamal data is 222 bytes long, containing:


+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ \|
\| + + \| Session Key \| + + \| \| + + \| \|
+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ \|
\| + + \| Pre-IV \| + + \| \| + + \| \|
+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ + + \|
\| + + \| 158 bytes random padding \| \~ \~ \| \| + +\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ \|
\| +\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ 

The 32-byte [Session
Key](#type_SessionKey) is the
identifier for the session. The 32-byte Pre-IV will be used to generate
the IV for the AES block that follows; the IV is the first 16 bytes of
the SHA-256 Hash of the Pre-IV.

The 222 byte payload is encrypted [using
ElGamal](#elgamal) and the encrypted block
is 514 bytes long.

### AES Block {#aes}

The unencrypted data in the AES block contains the following:


+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ \|tag
count\| \| +\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ + \| \| + + \| Session Tags \| \~ \~ \|
\| + + \| \| + +\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ \| \|
payload size \| \| +\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ +
\| \| + + \| Payload Hash \| + + \| \| + +\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ \| \|flag\|
\| +\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ + \| \| + +
\| New Session Key (opt.) \| + + \| \| + +\-\-\--+ \| \| \|
+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ + \| \| + + \|
Payload \| \~ \~ \| \| + +\-\-\--//\-\--+\-\-\--+ \| \| \|
+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--//\-\--+\-\-\--+ + \| Padding to 16 bytes \|
+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ 

#### Definition

 tag count: 2-byte \`Integer\`, 0-200
Session Tags: That many 32-byte \`SessionTag\`s payload size: 4-byte
\`Integer\` Payload Hash: The 32-byte SHA256 \`Hash\` of the payload
flag: A one-byte value. Normally == 0. If == 0x01, a Session Key follows
New Session Key: A 32-byte \`SessionKey\`, to replace the old key, and
is only present if preceding flag is 0x01 Payload: the data Padding:
Random data to a multiple of 16 bytes for the total length. May contain
more than the minimum required padding. Minimum
length: 48 bytes

The data is then [AES Encrypted](), using
the session key and IV (calculated from the pre-IV) from the ElGamal
section. The encrypted AES Block length is variable but is always a
multiple of 16 bytes.

#### MÃ¤rkused

- Actual max payload length, and max block length, is less than 64 KB;
 see the [I2NP Overview]().
- New Session Key is currently unused and is never present.

## Existing Session Message Specification {#existing}

The session tags delivered successfully are remembered for a brief
period (15 minutes currently) until they are used or discarded. A tag is
used by packaging one in an Existing Session Message that contains only
an AES encrypted block, and is not preceded by an ElGamal block.

The existing session message is as follows:


+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ \|
\| + + \| Session Tag \| + + \| \| + + \| \|
+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ \|
\| + + \| AES Encrypted Block \| \~ \~ \| \| + + \| \|
+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ 

#### Definition

 Session Tag: A 32-byte \`SessionTag\`
previously delivered in an AES block AES Encrypyted Block: As specified
above. 

The session tag also serves as the pre-IV. The IV is the first 16 bytes
of the SHA-256 Hash of the sessionTag.

To decode a message from an existing session, a router looks up the
Session Tag to find an associated Session Key. If the Session Tag is
found, the AES block is decrypted using the associated Session Key. If
the tag is not found, the message is assumed to be a [New Session
Message](#new).

## Session Tag Configuration Options {#config}

As of release 0.9.2, the client may configure the default number of
Session Tags to send and the low tag threshold for the current session.
For brief streaming connections or datagrams, these options may be used
to significantly reduce bandwidth. See the [I2CP options
specification](#options) for details. The session
settings may also be overridden on a per-message basis. See the [I2CP
Send Message Expires
specification](#msg_SendMessageExpires) for
details.

## Future Work {#future}

**Note:** ElGamal/AES+SessionTags is being replaced with
ECIES-X25519-AEAD-Ratchet (Proposal 144). The issues and ideas
referenced below have been incorporated into the design of the new
protocol. The following items will not be addressed in
ElGamal/AES+SessionTags.

There are many possible areas to tune the Session Key Manager\'s
algorithms; some may interact with the streaming library behavior, or
have significant impact on overall performance.

- The number of tags delivered could depend on message size, keeping
 in mind the eventual padding to 1KB at the tunnel message layer.
- Clients could send an estimate of session lifetime to the router, as
 an advisory on the number of tags required.
- Delivery of too few tags causes the router to fall back to an
 expensive ElGamal encryption.
- The router may assume delivery of Session Tags, or await
 acknowledgement before using them; there are tradeoffs for each
 strategy.
- For very brief messages, almost the full 222 bytes of the pre-IV and
 padding fields in the ElGamal block could be used for the entire
 message, instead of establishing a session.
- Evaluate padding strategy; currently we pad to a minimum of 128
 bytes. Would be better to add a few tags to small messages than pad.
- Perhaps things could be more efficient if the Session Tag system was
 bidirectional, so tags delivered in the \'forward\' path could be
 used in the \'reverse\' path, thus avoiding ElGamal in the initial
 response. The router currently plays some tricks like this when
 sending tunnel test messages to itself.
- Change from Session Tags to [a synchronized
 PRNG](#prng).
- Several of these ideas may require a new I2NP message type, or set a
 flag in the [Delivery
 Instructions](#struct_TunnelMessageDeliveryInstructions),
 or set a magic number in the first few bytes of the Session Key
 field and accept a small risk of the random Session Key matching the
 magic number.

 Tunnel Routing July 2011 0.8.7 

## Yhteenveto

This page contains an overview of I2P tunnel terminology and operation,
with links to more technical pages, details, and specifications.

As briefly explained in the [introduction](), I2P
builds virtual \"tunnels\" - temporary and unidirectional paths through
a sequence of routers. These tunnels are classified as either inbound
tunnels (where everything given to it goes towards the creator of the
tunnel) or outbound tunnels (where the tunnel creator shoves messages
away from them). When Alice wants to send a message to Bob, she will
(typically) send it out one of her existing outbound tunnels with
instructions for that tunnel\'s endpoint to forward it to the gateway
router for one of Bob\'s current inbound tunnels, which in turn passes
it to Bob.

 A: Outbound Gateway (Alice)
 B: Outbound Participant
 C: Outbound Endpoint
 D: Inbound Gateway
 E: Inbound Participant
 F: Inbound Endpoint (Bob)

## Tunnel vocabulary

- **Tunnel gateway** - the first router in a tunnel. For inbound
 tunnels, this is the one mentioned in the LeaseSet published in the
 [network database](). For outbound tunnels,
 the gateway is the originating router. (e.g. both A and D above)
- **Tunnel endpoint** - the last router in a tunnel. (e.g. both C and
 F above)
- **Tunnel participant** - all routers in a tunnel except for the
 gateway or endpoint (e.g. both B and E above)
- **n-Hop tunnel** - a tunnel with a specific number of inter-router
 jumps, e.g.:
 - **0-hop tunnel** - a tunnel where the gateway is also the
 endpoint
 - **1-hop tunnel** - a tunnel where the gateway talks directly to
 the endpoint
 - **2-(or more)-hop tunnel** - a tunnel where there is at least
 one intermediate tunnel participant. (the above diagram includes
 two 2-hop tunnels - one outbound from Alice, one inbound to Bob)
- **Tunnel ID** - A [4 byte
 integer](#type_TunnelId) different
 for each hop in a tunnel, and unique among all tunnels on a router.
 Chosen randomly by the tunnel creator.

## Tunnel Build Information

Routers performing the three roles (gateway, participant, endpoint) are
given different pieces of data in the initial [Tunnel Build
Message]() to accomplish their tasks:

- **The tunnel gateway gets:**
 - **tunnel encryption key** - an [AES private
 key](#type_SessionKey) for
 encrypting messages and instructions to the next hop
 - **tunnel IV key** - an [AES private
 key](#type_SessionKey) for
 double-encrypting the IV to the next hop
 - **reply key** - an [AES public
 key](#type_SessionKey) for
 encrypting the reply to the tunnel build request
 - **reply IV** - the IV for encrypting the reply to the tunnel
 build request
 - **tunnel id** - 4 byte integer (inbound gateways only)
 - **next hop** - what router is the next one in the path (unless
 this is a 0-hop tunnel, and the gateway is also the endpoint)
 - **next tunnel id** - The tunnel ID on the next hop
- **All intermediate tunnel participants get:**
 - **tunnel encryption key** - an [AES private
 key](#type_SessionKey) for
 encrypting messages and instructions to the next hop
 - **tunnel IV key** - an [AES private
 key](#type_SessionKey) for
 double-encrypting the IV to the next hop
 - **reply key** - an [AES public
 key](#type_SessionKey) for
 encrypting the reply to the tunnel build request
 - **reply IV** - the IV for encrypting the reply to the tunnel
 build request
 - **tunnel id** - 4 byte integer
 - **next hop** - what router is the next one in the path
 - **next tunnel id** - The tunnel ID on the next hop
- **The tunnel endpoint gets:**
 - **tunnel encryption key** - an [AES private
 key](#type_SessionKey) for
 encrypting messages and instructions to the the endpoint
 (itself)
 - **tunnel IV key** - an [AES private
 key](#type_SessionKey) for
 double-encrypting the IV to the endpoint (itself)
 - **reply key** - an [AES public
 key](#type_SessionKey) for
 encrypting the reply to the tunnel build request (outbound
 endpoints only)
 - **reply IV** - the IV for encrypting the reply to the tunnel
 build request (outbound endpoints only)
 - **tunnel id** - 4 byte integer (outbound endpoints only)
 - **reply router** - the inbound gateway of the tunnel to send the
 reply through (outbound endpoints only)
 - **reply tunnel id** - The tunnel ID of the reply router
 (outbound endpoints only)

Details are in the [tunnel creation
specification]().

## Tunnel pooling

Several tunnels for a particular purpose may be grouped into a \"tunnel
pool\", as described in the [tunnel
specification](#tunnel.pooling). This
provides redundancy and additional bandwidth. The pools used by the
router itself are called \"exploratory tunnels\". The pools used by
applications are called \"client tunnels\".

## Tunnel length {#length}

As mentioned above, each client requests that their router provide
tunnels to include at least a certain number of hops. The decision as to
how many routers to have in one\'s outbound and inbound tunnels has an
important effect upon the latency, throughput, reliability, and
anonymity provided by I2P - the more peers that messages have to go
through, the longer it takes to get there and the more likely that one
of those routers will fail prematurely. The less routers in a tunnel,
the easier it is for an adversary to mount traffic analysis attacks and
pierce someone\'s anonymity. Tunnel lengths are specified by clients via
[I2CP options](#options). The maximum number of
hops in a tunnel is 7.

### 0-hop tunnels

With no remote routers in a tunnel, the user has very basic plausible
deniability (since no one knows for sure that the peer that sent them
the message wasn\'t simply just forwarding it on as part of the tunnel).
However, it would be fairly easy to mount a statistical analysis attack
and notice that messages targeting a specific destination are always
sent through a single gateway. Statistical analysis against outbound
0-hop tunnels are more complex, but could show similar information
(though would be slightly harder to mount).

### 1-hop tunnels

With only one remote router in a tunnel, the user has both plausible
deniability and basic anonymity, as long as they are not up against an
internal adversary (as described on [threat
model]()). However, if the adversary ran a
sufficient number of routers such that the single remote router in the
tunnel is often one of those compromised ones, they would be able to
mount the above statistical traffic analysis attack.

### 2-hop tunnels

With two or more remote routers in a tunnel, the costs of mounting the
traffic analysis attack increases, since many remote routers would have
to be compromised to mount it.

### 3-hop (or more) tunnels

To reduce the susceptibility to [some attacks](), 3
or more hops are recommended for the highest level of protection.
[Recent studies]() also conclude that more than 3
hops does not provide additional protection.

### Tunnel default lengths

The router uses 2-hop tunnels by default for its exploratory tunnels.
Client tunnel defaults are set by the application, using [I2CP
options](#options). Most applications use 2 or 3
hops as their default.

## Tunnel testing {#testing}

All tunnels are periodically tested by their creator by sending a
DeliveryStatusMessage out an outbound tunnel and bound for another
inbound tunnel (testing both tunnels at once). If either fails a number
of consecutive tests, it is marked as no longer functional. If it was
used for a client\'s inbound tunnel, a new leaseSet is created. Tunnel
test failures are also reflected in the [capacity rating in the peer
profile](#capacity).

## Tunnel creation

Tunnel creation is handled by [garlic
routing]() a Tunnel Build Message to a
router, requesting that they participate in the tunnel (providing them
with all of the appropriate information, as above, along with a
certificate, which right now is a \'null\' cert, but will support
hashcash or other non-free certificates when necessary). That router
forwards the message to the next hop in the tunnel. Details are in the
[tunnel creation specification]().

## Tunnel encryption

Multi-layer encryption is handled by [garlic
encryption]() of tunnel messages. Details
are in the [tunnel specification](). The IV
of each hop is encrypted with a separate key as explained there.

## Future Work

- Other tunnel test techniques could be used, such as garlic wrapping
 a number of tests into cloves, testing individual tunnel
 participants separately, etc.
- Move to 3-hop exploratory tunnels defaults.
- In a distant future release, options specifying the pooling, mixing,
 and chaff generation settings may be implemented.
- In a distant future release, limits on the quantity and size of
 messages allowed during the tunnel\'s lifetime may be implemented
 (e.g. no more than 300 messages or 1MB per minute).

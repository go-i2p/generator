## Что мы подразумеваем под словом \"анонимность\"?

Your level of anonymity can be described as \"how hard it is for someone
to find out information you don\'t want them to know?\" - who you are,
where you are located, who you communicate with, or even when you
communicate. \"Perfect\" anonymity is not a useful concept here -
software will not make you indistinguishable from people that don\'t use
computers or who are not on the Internet. Instead, we are working to
provide sufficient anonymity to meet the real needs of whomever we can -
from those simply browsing websites, to those exchanging data, to those
fearful of discovery by powerful organizations or states.

Сложный вопрос, обеспечивает ли I2P достаточную анонимность для ваших
конкретных целей, но мы надеемся, что эта страница поможет на него
ответить, разъясняя, как I2P ведёт себя в случае различных атак, и
позволяя решить, соответствует ли такое поведение вашим требованиям.

Мы приветствуем дальнейшие исследования и анализ касательно
противостояния I2P описанным ниже угрозам. Требуется больше обзоров и
контроля существующей литературы (большинство её посвящено Tor), а также
самостоятельных работ об I2P.

## Обзор топологии сети

I2P builds off the ideas of many [other]()
[systems](), but a few key points should be kept
in mind when reviewing related literature:

- **I2P is a free route mixnet** - the message creator explicitly
 defines the path that messages will be sent out (the outbound
 tunnel), and the message recipient explicitly defines the path that
 messages will be received on (the inbound tunnel).
- **I2P has no official entry and exit points** - all peers fully
 participate in the mix, and there are no network layer in- or
 out-proxies (however, at the application layer, a few proxies do
 exist)
- **I2P is fully distributed** - there are no central controls or
 authorities. One could modify some routers to operate mix cascades
 (building tunnels and giving out the keys necessary to control the
 forwarding at the tunnel endpoint) or directory based profiling and
 selection, all without breaking compatibility with the rest of the
 network, but doing so is of course not necessary (and may even harm
 one\'s anonymity).

We have documented plans to implement [nontrivial
delays](#stop) and [batching
strategies](#batching) whose existence is only
known to the particular hop or tunnel gateway that receives the message,
allowing a mostly low latency mixnet to provide cover traffic for higher
latency communication (e.g. email). However we are aware that
significant delays are required to provide meaningful protection, and
that implementation of such delays will be a significant challenge. It
is not clear at this time whether we will actually implement these delay
features.

In theory, routers along the message path may inject an arbitrary number
of hops before forwarding the message to the next peer, though the
current implementation does not.

## Модель угроз

I2P design started in 2003, not long after the advent of [\[Onion
Routing\]](http://www.onion-router.net),
[\[Freenet\]](http://freenetproject.org/), and
[\[Tor\]](https://www.torproject.org/). Our design benefits
substantially from the research published around that time. I2P uses
several onion routing techniques, so we continue to benefit from the
significant academic interest in Tor.

Taking from the attacks and analysis put forth in the [anonymity
literature](http://freehaven.net/anonbib/topic.html) (largely [Traffic
Analysis: Protocols, Attacks, Design Issues and Open
Problems](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/454354.html)), the following
briefly describes a wide variety of attacks as well as many of I2Ps
defenses. We update this list to include new attacks as they are
identified.

Included are some attacks that may be unique to I2P. We do not have good
answers for all these attacks, however we continue to do research and
improve our defenses.

In addition, many of these attacks are significantly easier than they
should be, due to the modest size of the current network. While we are
aware of some limitations that need to be addressed, I2P is designed to
support hundreds of thousands, or millions, of participants. As we
continue to spread the word and grow the network, these attacks will
become much harder.

The [network comparisons]() and [\"garlic\"
terminology]() pages may also be helpful
to review.

{# Hide DREAD ratings until we know how we want to use them

Attacks are judged using the [modified **DREAD**
model]():

- **Damage Potential**: If a threat exploit occurs, how much damage
 will be caused?
- **Reliability**: How reliable is the attack?
- **Exploitability**: What is needed to exploit this threat?
- **Affected Users**: How many users will be affected?
- **Discoverability**: How easy is it to discover this threat?

Each category is given a rating of low, medium or high. The severity and
priority scores are calculated using the equations outlined
[here]().

#}

### Атаки методом полного перебора {#bruteforce}

{# DREAD_score(2, 1, 1, 1, 3) #}

A brute force attack can be mounted by a global passive or active
adversary, watching all the messages pass between all of the nodes and
attempting to correlate which message follows which path. Mounting this
attack against I2P should be nontrivial, as all peers in the network are
frequently sending messages (both end to end and network maintenance
messages), plus an end to end message changes size and data along its
path. In addition, the external adversary does not have access to the
messages either, as inter-router communication is both encrypted and
streamed (making two 1024 byte messages indistinguishable from one 2048
byte message).

However, a powerful attacker can use brute force to detect trends - if
they can send 5GB to an I2P destination and monitor everyone\'s network
connection, they can eliminate all peers who did not receive 5GB of
data. Techniques to defeat this attack exist, but may be prohibitively
expensive (see:
[Tarzan](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/freedman02tarzan.html)\'s mimics or
constant rate traffic). Most users are not concerned with this attack,
as the cost of mounting it are extreme (and often require illegal
activity). However, the attack is still possible, for example by an
observer at a large ISP or an Internet exchange point. Those who want to
defend against it would want to take appropriate countermeasures, such
as setting low bandwidth limits, and using unpublished or encrypted
leasesets for I2P Sites. Other countermeasures, such as nontrivial
delays and restricted routes, are not currently implemented.

As a partial defense against a single router or group of routers trying
to route all the network\'s traffic, routers contain limits as to how
many tunnels can be routed through a single peer. As the network grows,
these limits are subject to further adjustment. Other mechanisms for
peer rating, selection and avoidance are discussed on the [peer
selection page]().

### Атака по времени {#timing}

{# DREAD_score(2, 2, 2, 3, 2) #}

I2P\'s messages are unidirectional and do not necessarily imply that a
reply will be sent. However, applications on top of I2P will most likely
have recognizable patterns within the frequency of their messages - for
instance, an HTTP request will be a small message with a large sequence
of reply messages containing the HTTP response. Using this data as well
as a broad view of the network topology, an attacker may be able to
disqualify some links as being too slow to have passed the message
along.

This sort of attack is powerful, but its applicability to I2P is non
obvious, as the variation on message delays due to queuing, message
processing, and throttling will often meet or exceed the time of passing
a message along a single link - even when the attacker knows that a
reply will be sent as soon as the message is received. There are some
scenarios which will expose fairly automatic replies though - the
streaming library does (with the SYN+ACK) as does the message mode of
guaranteed delivery (with the DataMessage+DeliveryStatusMessage).

Without protocol scrubbing or higher latency, global active adversaries
can gain substantial information. As such, people concerned with these
attacks could increase the latency (using [nontrivial
delays](#stop) or [batching
strategies](#batching)), include protocol
scrubbing, or other advanced tunnel routing
[techniques](#batching), but these are
unimplemented in I2P.

Systems]()

### Intersection attacks {#intersection}

{# DREAD_score(3, 2, 2, 3, 3) #}

Intersection attacks against low latency systems are extremely
powerful - periodically make contact with the target and keep track of
what peers are on the network. Over time, as node churn occurs the
attacker will gain significant information about the target by simply
intersecting the sets of peers that are online when a message
successfully goes through. The cost of this attack is significant as the
network grows, but may be feasible in some scenarios.

In summary, if an attacker is at both ends of your tunnel at the same
time, he may be successful. I2P does not have a full defense to this for
low latency communication. This is an inherent weakness of low-latency
onion routing. Tor provides a [similar
disclaimer]().

Partial defenses implemented in I2P:

- [strict ordering](#ordering) of peers
- [peer profiling and selection]() from
 a small group that changes slowly
- Limits on the number of tunnels routed through a single peer
- Prevention of peers from the same /16 IP range from being members of
 a single tunnel
- For I2P Sites or other hosted services, we support simultaneous
 hosting on multiple routers, or [multihoming](#intersection)

Even in total, these defenses are not a complete solution. Also, we have
made some design choices that may significantly increase our
vulnerability:

- We do not use low-bandwidth \"guard nodes\"
- We use tunnel pools comprised of several tunnels, and traffic can
 shift from tunnel to tunnel.
- Tunnels are not long-lived; new tunnels are built every 10 minutes.
- Tunnel lengths are configurable. While 3-hop tunnels are recommended
 for full protection, several applications and services use 2-hop
 tunnels by default.

In the future, it could for peers who can afford significant delays (per
[nontrivial delays](#stop) and [batching
strategies](#batching)). In addition, this is only
relevant for destinations that other people know about - a private group
whose destination is only known to trusted peers does not have to worry,
as an adversary can\'t \"ping\" them to mount the attack.

### Отказ в обслуживании {#dos}

There are a whole slew of denial of service attacks available against
I2P, each with different costs and consequences:

{# DREAD_score(1, 1, 2, 1, 3) #}

**Greedy user attack:** This is simply people trying to consume
significantly more resources than they are willing to contribute. The
defense against this is:

- Set defaults so that most users provide resources to the network. In
 I2P, users route traffic by default. In sharp distinction to [other
 networks](), over 95% of I2P users
 relay traffic for others.
- Provide easy configuration options so that users may increase their
 contribution (share percentage) to the network. Display
 easy-to-understand metrics such as \"share ratio\" so that users may
 see what they are contributing.
- Maintain a strong community with blogs, forums, IRC, and other means
 of communication.

::: {style="clear:both"}
:::

{# DREAD_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 3) #}

**Starvation attack:** A hostile user may attempt to harm the network by
creating a significant number of peers in the network who are not
identified as being under control of the same entity (as with Sybil).
These nodes then decide not to provide any resources to the network,
causing existing peers to search through a larger network database or
request more tunnels than should be necessary. Alternatively, the nodes
may provide intermittent service by periodically dropping selected
traffic, or refusing connections to certain peers. This behavior may be
indistinguishable from that of a heavily-loaded or failing node. I2P
addresses these issues by maintaining
[profiles]() on the peers, attempting to
identify underperforming ones and simply ignoring them, or using them
rarely. We have significantly enhanced the ability to recognize and
avoid troublesome peers; however there are still significant efforts
required in this area.

::: {style="clear:both"}
:::

{# DREAD_score(1, 2, 2, 2, 3) #}

**Flooding attack:** A hostile user may attempt to flood the network, a
peer, a destination, or a tunnel. Network and peer flooding is possible,
and I2P does nothing to prevent standard IP layer flooding. The flooding
of a destination with messages by sending a large number to the
target\'s various inbound tunnel gateways is possible, but the
destination will know this both by the contents of the message and
because the tunnel\'s tests will fail. The same goes for flooding just a
single tunnel. I2P has no defenses for a network flooding attack. For a
destination and tunnel flooding attack, the target identifies which
tunnels are unresponsive and builds new ones. New code could also be
written to add even more tunnels if the client wishes to handle the
larger load. If, on the other hand, the load is more than the client can
deal with, they can instruct the tunnels to throttle the number of
messages or bytes they should pass on (once the [advanced tunnel
operation](#batching) is implemented).

::: {style="clear:both"}
:::

{# DREAD_score(1, 1, 1, 1, 1) #}

**CPU load attack:** There are currently some methods for people to
remotely request that a peer perform some cryptographically expensive
operation, and a hostile attacker could use these to flood that peer
with a large number of them in an attempt to overload the CPU. Both
using good engineering practices and potentially requiring nontrivial
certificates (e.g. HashCash) to be attached to these expensive requests
should mitigate the issue, though there may be room for an attacker to
exploit various bugs in the implementation.

::: {style="clear:both"}
:::

{# DREAD_score(2, 2, 3, 2, 3) #}

**Floodfill DOS attack:** A hostile user may attempt to harm the network
by becoming a floodfill router. The current defenses against unreliable,
intermittent, or malicious floodfill routers are poor. A floodfill
router may provide bad or no response to lookups, and it may also
interfere with inter-floodfill communication. Some defenses and [peer
profiling]() are implemented, however
there is much more to do. For more information see the [network database
page](#threat).

### Tagging attacks {#tagging}

{# DREAD_score(1, 3, 1, 1, 1) #}

Tagging attacks - modifying a message so that it can later be identified
further along the path - are by themselves impossible in I2P, as
messages passed through tunnels are signed. However, if an attacker is
the inbound tunnel gateway as well as a participant further along in
that tunnel, with collusion they can identify the fact that they are in
the same tunnel (and prior to adding [unique hop
ids](#tunnelId) and other updates, colluding peers
within the same tunnel can recognize that fact without any effort). An
attacker in an outbound tunnel and any part of an inbound tunnel cannot
collude however, as the tunnel encryption pads and modifies the data
separately for the inbound and outbound tunnels. External attackers
cannot do anything, as the links are encrypted and messages signed.

### Partitioning attacks {#partitioning}

{# DREAD_score(3, 1, 1, 1, 2) #}

Partitioning attacks - finding ways to segregate (technically or
analytically) the peers in a network - are important to keep in mind
when dealing with a powerful adversary, since the size of the network
plays a key role in determining your anonymity. Technical partitioning
by cutting links between peers to create fragmented networks is
addressed by I2P\'s built in network database, which maintains
statistics about various peers so as to allow any existing connections
to other fragmented sections to be exploited so as to heal the network.
However, if the attacker does disconnect all links to uncontrolled
peers, essentially isolating the target, no amount of network database
healing will fix it. At that point, the only thing the router can hope
to do is notice that a significant number of previously reliable peers
have become unavailable and alert the client that it is temporarily
disconnected (this detection code is not implemented at the moment).

Partitioning the network analytically by looking for differences in how
routers and destinations behave and grouping them accordingly is also a
very powerful attack. For instance, an attacker
[harvesting](#harvesting) the network database will know when a
particular destination has 5 inbound tunnels in their LeaseSet while
others have only 2 or 3, allowing the adversary to potentially partition
clients by the number of tunnels selected. Another partition is possible
when dealing with the [nontrivial delays](#stop)
and [batching strategies](#batching), as the
tunnel gateways and the particular hops with non-zero delays will likely
stand out. However, this data is only exposed to those specific hops, so
to partition effectively on that matter, the attacker would need to
control a significant portion of the network (and still that would only
be a probabilistic partition, as they wouldn\'t know which other tunnels
or messages have those delays).

Also discussed on the [network database
page](#threat) (bootstrap attack).

### Predecessor attacks {#predecessor}

{# DREAD_score(1, 1, 1, 1, 3) #}

The predecessor attack is passively gathering statistics in an attempt
to see what peers are \'close\' to the destination by participating in
their tunnels and keeping track of the previous or next hop (for
outbound or inbound tunnels, respectively). Over time, using a perfectly
random sample of peers and random ordering, an attacker would be able to
see which peer shows up as \'closer\' statistically more than the rest,
and that peer would in turn be where the target is located.

I2P avoids this in four ways: first, the peers selected to participate
in tunnels are not randomly sampled throughout the network - they are
derived from the [peer selection]()
algorithm which breaks them into tiers. Second, with [strict
ordering](#ordering) of peers in a tunnel,
the fact that a peer shows up more frequently does not mean they\'re the
source. Third, with [permuted tunnel
length](#length) (not enabled by default)
even 0 hop tunnels can provide plausible deniability as the occasional
variation of the gateway will look like normal tunnels. Fourth, with
[restricted routes](#fullRestrictedRoutes)
(unimplemented), only the peer with a restricted connection to the
target will ever contact the target, while attackers will merely run
into that gateway.

The current [tunnel build method]() was
specifically designed to combat the predecessor attack. See also [the
intersection attack](#intersection).

References: []() which is an
update to the 2004 predecessor attack paper []().

### Harvesting attacks {#harvesting}

{# DREAD_score(1, 1, 2, 2, 3) #}

\"Harvesting\" means compiling a list of users running I2P. It can be
used for legal attacks and to help other attacks by simply running a
peer, seeing who it connects to, and harvesting whatever references to
other peers it can find.

I2P itself is not designed with effective defenses against this attack,
since there is the distributed network database containing just this
information. The following factors make the attack somewhat harder in
practice:

- Network growth will make it more difficult to obtain a given
 proportion of the network
- Floodfill routers implement query limits as DOS protection
- \"Hidden mode\", which prevents a router from publishing its
 information to the netDb, (but also prevents it from relaying data)
 is not widely used now but could be.

In future implementations, [basic](#nat) and
[comprehensive](#fullRestrictedRoutes) restricted
routes, this attack loses much of its power, as the \"hidden\" peers do
not publish their contact addresses in the network database - only the
tunnels through which they can be reached (as well as their public keys,
etc).

In the future, routers could use GeoIP to identify if they are in a
particular country where identification as an I2P node would be risky.
In that case, the router could automatically enable hidden mode, or
enact other restricted route methods.

### Identification Through Traffic Analysis {#traffic}

{# DREAD_score(1, 1, 2, 3, 3) #}

By inspecting the traffic into and out of a router, a malicious ISP or
state-level firewall could identify that a computer is running I2P. As
discussed [above](#harvesting), I2P is not specifically designed to hide
that a computer is running I2P. However, several design decisions made
in the design of the [transport layer and
protocols]() make it somewhat difficult to
identify I2P traffic:

- Случайный выбор порта
- Point-to-Point Encryption of all traffic
- DH key exchange with no protocol bytes or other unencrypted constant
 fields
- Simultaneous use of both [TCP]() and
 [UDP]() transports. UDP may be much harder for
 some Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) equipment to track.

In the near future, we plan to directly address traffic analysis issues
by further obfuscation of I2P transport protocols, possibly including:

- Padding at the transport layer to random lengths, especially during
 the connection handshake
- Study of packet size distribution signatures, and additional padding
 as necessary
- Development of additional transport methods that mimic SSL or other
 common protocols
- Review of padding strategies at higher layers to see how they affect
 packet sizes at the transport layer
- Review of methods implemented by various state-level firewalls to
 block Tor
- Working directly with DPI and obfuscation experts

Obfuscation]()

### Атаки Sybil {#sybil}

{# DREAD_score(3, 2, 1, 3, 3) #}

Sybil describes a category of attacks where the adversary creates
arbitrarily large numbers of colluding nodes and uses the increased
numbers to help mounting other attacks. For instance, if an attacker is
in a network where peers are selected randomly and they want an 80%
chance to be one of those peers, they simply create five times the
number of nodes that are in the network and roll the dice. When identity
is free, Sybil can be a very potent technique for a powerful adversary.
The primary technique to address this is simply to make identity \'non
free\' - [Tarzan](http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/tarzan/) (among others)
uses the fact that IP addresses are limited, while IIP used
[HashCash](http://www.hashcash.org/) to \'charge\' for creating a new
identity. We currently have not implemented any particular technique to
address Sybil, but do include placeholder certificates in the router\'s
and destination\'s data structures which can contain a HashCash
certificate of appropriate value when necessary (or some other
certificate proving scarcity).

Requiring HashCash Certificates in various places has two major
problems:

- Maintaining backward compatibility
- The classic HashCash problem - selecting HashCash values that are
 meaningful proofs of work on high-end machines, while still being
 feasible on low-end machines such as mobile devices.

Various limitations on the number of routers in a given IP range
restrict the vulnerability to attackers that don\'t have the ability to
put machines in several IP blocks. However, this is not a meaningful
defense against a powerful adversary.

See the [network database page](#threat) for more
Sybil discussion.

### Buddy Exhaustion attacks {#buddy}

{# DREAD_score(3, 2, 2, 1, 3) #}

(Reference: [In Search of an Anonymous and Secure
Lookup]() Section 5.2)

By refusing to accept or forward tunnel build requests, except to a
colluding peer, a router could ensure that a tunnel is formed wholly
from its set of colluding routers. The chances of success are enhanced
if there is a large number of colluding routers, i.e. a [Sybil
attack](#sybil). This is somewhat mitigated by our [peer
profiling]() methods used to monitor the
performance of peers. However, this is a powerful attack as the number
of routers approaches *f* = 0.2, or 20% malicious nodes, as specifed in
the paper. The malicous routers could also maintain connections to the
target router and provide excellent forwarding bandwidth for traffic
over those connections, in an attempt to manipulate the profiles managed
by the target and appear attractive. Further research and defenses may
be necessary.

### Криптографические атаки {#crypto}

{# DREAD_score(3, 2, 1, 3, 1) #}

We use strong cryptography with long keys, and we assume the security of
the industry-standard cryptographic primitives used in I2P, as
documented [on the low-level cryptography
page](). Security features include the
immediate detection of altered messages along the path, the inability to
decrypt messages not addressed to you, and defense against
man-in-the-middle attacks. The key sizes chosen in 2003 were quite
conservative at the time, and are still longer than those used in [other
anonymity networks](https://torproject.org/). We don\'t think the
current key lengths are our biggest weakness, especially for
traditional, non-state-level adversaries; bugs and the small size of the
network are much more worrisome. Of course, all cryptographic algorithms
eventually become obsolete due to the advent of faster processors,
cryptographic research, and advancements in methods such as rainbow
tables, clusters of video game hardware, etc. Unfortunately, I2P was not
designed with easy mechanisms to lengthen keys or change shared secret
values while maintaining backward compatibility.

Upgrading the various data structures and protocols to support longer
keys will have to be tackled eventually, and this will be a [major
undertaking](), just as it will be for
[others](https://torproject.org/). Hopefully, through careful planning,
we can minimize the disruption, and implement mechanisms to make it
easier for future transitions.

In the future, several I2P protocols and data structures support
securely padding messages to arbitrary sizes, so messages could be made
constant size or garlic messages could be modified randomly so that some
cloves appear to contain more subcloves than they actually do. At the
moment, however, garlic, tunnel, and end to end messages include simple
random padding.

### Floodfill Anonymity attacks {#floodfill}

{# DREAD_score(3, 2, 1, 2, 2) #}

In addition to the floodfill DOS attacks described [above](#ffdos),
floodfill routers are uniquely positioned to learn about network
participants, due to their role in the netDb, and the high frequency of
communication with those participants. This is somewhat mitigated
because floodfill routers only manage a portion of the total keyspace,
and the keyspace rotates daily, as explained on the [network database
page](#threat). The specific mechanisms by which
routers communicate with floodfills have been [carefully
designed](#delivery). However, these threats
should be studied further. The specific potential threats and
corresponding defenses are a topic for future research.

### Другие атаки на сетевую базу данных {#netdb}

A hostile user may attempt to harm the network by creating one or more
floodfill routers and crafting them to offer bad, slow, or no responses.
Several scenarios are discussed on the [network database
page](#threat).

### Central Resource Attacks {#central}

{# DREAD_score(1, 1, 1, 3, 3) #}

There are a few centralized or limited resources (some inside I2P, some
not) that could be attacked or used as a vector for attacks. The absence
of jrandom starting November 2007, followed by the loss of the i2p.net
hosting service in January 2008, highlighted numerous centralized
resources in the development and operation of the I2P network, most of
which are now distributed. Attacks on externally-reachable resources
mainly affect the ability of new users to find us, not the operation of
the network itself.

- The [website]() is mirrored and uses DNS
 round-robin for external public access.
- Routers now support [multiple external reseed
 locations](#reseed), however more reseed hosts
 may be needed, and the handling of unreliable or malicious reseed
 hosts may need improvement.
- Routers now support multiple update file locations. A malicious
 update host could feed a huge file, need to limit the size.
- Routers now support multiple default trusted update signers.
- Routers now better handle [multiple unreliable floodfill
 peers](#ffdos). Malicious floodfills [needs](#ffdos)
 [more](#floodfill) study.
- The code is now stored in a [distributed source control
 system]().
- Routers rely on a single news host, but there is a hardcoded backup
 URL pointing to a different host. A malicious news host could feed a
 huge file, need to limit the size.
- [Naming system services](), including
 address book subscription providers, add-host services, and jump
 services, could be malicious. Substantial protections for
 subscriptions were implemented in release 0.6.1.31, with additional
 enhancements in subsequent releases. However, all naming services
 require some measure of trust, see [the naming
 page]() for details.
- We remain reliant on the DNS service for i2p2.de, losing this would
 cause substantial disruption in our ability to attract new users,
 and would shrink the network (in the short-to-medium term), just as
 the loss of i2p.net did.

### Атаки на разработку {#dev}

{# DREAD_score(2, 1, 1, 3, 1) #}

These attacks aren\'t directly on the network, but instead go after its
development team by either introducing legal hurdles on anyone
contributing to the development of the software, or by using whatever
means are available to get the developers to subvert the software.
Traditional technical measures cannot defeat these attacks, and if
someone threatened the life or livelihood of a developer (or even just
issuing a court order along with a gag order, under threat of prison),
we would have a big problem.

However, two techniques help defend against these attacks:

- All components of the network must be open source to enable
 inspection, verification, modification, and improvement. If a
 developer is compromised, once it is noticed the community should
 demand explanation and cease to accept that developer\'s work. All
 checkins to our [distributed source control
 system]() are cryptographically signed,
 and the release packagers use a trust-list system to restrict
 modifications to those previously approved.
- Development over the network itself, allowing developers to stay
 anonymous but still secure the development process. All I2P
 development can occur through I2P - using a [distributed source
 control system](), a distributed source
 control system, IRC chat, public web servers, discussion forums
 (forum.i2p), and the software distribution sites, all available
 within I2P.

### Атаки на реализацию (ошибки) {#impl}

{# DREAD_score(2, 2, 1, 3, 1) #}

Try as we might, most nontrivial applications include errors in the
design or implementation, and I2P is no exception. There may be bugs
that could be exploited to attack the anonymity or security of the
communication running over I2P in unexpected ways. To help withstand
attacks against the design or protocols in use, we publish all designs
and documentation and solicit review and criticism with the hope that
many eyes will improve the system. We do not believe in [security
through obscurity](http://www.haystacknetwork.com/).

In addition, the code is being treated the same way, with little
aversion towards reworking or throwing out something that isn\'t meeting
the needs of the software system (including ease of modification).
Documentation for the design and implementation of the network and the
software components are an essential part of security, as without them
it is unlikely that developers would be willing to spend the time to
learn the software enough to identify shortcomings and bugs.

Our software is likely, in particular, to contain bugs related to denial
of service through out-of-memory errors (OOMs), cross-site-scripting
(XSS) issues in the router console, and other vulnerabilities to
non-standard inputs via the various protocols.

I2P is still a small network with a small development community and
almost no interest from academic or research groups. Therefore we lack
the analysis that [other anonymity networks](https://torproject.org/)
may have received. We continue to recruit people to [get
involved]() and help.

### Blocklists {#blocklist}

To some extent, I2P could be enhanced to avoid peers operating at IP
addresses listed in a blocklist. Several blocklists are commonly
available in standard formats, listing anti-P2P organizations, potential
state-level adversaries, and others.

To the extent that active peers actually do show up in the actual
blocklist, blocking by only a subset of peers would tend to segment the
network, exacerbate reachability problems, and decrease overall
reliability. Therefore we would want to agree on a particular blocklist
and enable it by default.

Blocklists are only a part (perhaps a small part) of an array of
defenses against maliciousness. In large part the profiling system does
a good job of measuring router behavior so that we don\'t need to trust
anything in netDb. However there is more that can be done. For each of
the areas in the list above there are improvements we can make in
detecting badness.

If a blocklist is hosted at a central location with automatic updates
the network is vulnerable to a [central resource attack](#central).
Automatic subscription to a list gives the list provider the power to
shut the i2p network down. Completely.

Currently, a default blocklist is distributed with our software, listing
only the IPs of past DOS sources. There is no automatic update
mechanism. Should a particular IP range implement serious attacks on the
I2P network, we would have to ask people to update their blocklist
manually through out-of-band mechanisms such as forums, blogs, etc.

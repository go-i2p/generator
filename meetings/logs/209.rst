* **Network Health - IRC**
    * Russian User Support: Russians are the top country using I2P at
      this time, followed by USA and Germany. We know of one dedicated
      Russian user that is providing help in our IRC channel #ru
      (also see next point). If we add to this area, that would be
      great. Since most of the network is russian it makes sense to
      make sure they get quality help so they are running their
      router optimally.

    * Complementing the above issue would be to have our irc operators
      redirect_ either #ru -> #i2p-ru or vice versa, there seems to be
      conflicting advice given to russian users asking for directions
      in this area::

        KillYourTV    user 'slow' fits there
        KillYourTV    (and he's nearly always in #ru)
        dg            btw, #ru has users, #i2p-ru does not

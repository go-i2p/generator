* The next NetDB backend
    * Fast key rotation is probably meaningless according to discussions with christop egger.
    * Regarding building a completely new overlay, that may be difficult task.

* Ticket #729 - properties location on osx
    * zab/topiltzin will merge. Meehs attention is requested for some testing.

* Ticket #741 - process renamer on windows
    * KillYouTV agreed to some Win8 x84/x64 testing.
    * Defaults of the new i2p exe are not set up/working yet.
    * Icons for the I2P executables are not available in high quality/svg. -> Bad looks.

* Misc?
    * Sponge: Bridge API for UDP (BOB) RFC
    * Sponge: IPV6 and de-anonymization since the address space is so large that each user and device is likely to have an address.
    * Sponge: Will be around more Real Soon Now (tm).
    * Orion: i2pcpp supports ipv6.
